  Comment: A berry rich cocktail laced with whiskey, flavoured with Amaretto and topped with ginger beer.
  Origin: Adapted in 2003 from a  recipe Alex Kammerling created for TGI Friday's UK. Named partly for the ingredients and partly as a reference to Jack Daniel's proprietor (and nephew), Lemuel Motlow, who took up mule trading during Prohibition.
