  Comment: The success or failure of this tangy drink is partly reliant on the quality of marmalade used.
  Origin: Created in the late 1990s by Salvatore Calabrese at the Library Bar, London, England. It is very similar to the 'Marmalade Cocktail' created in the 1920s by Harry Craddock and published in his 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book' or you could describe this as being White Lady with marmalade in it.<br />    <br />Salvatore came up with the idea for this drink after his wife insisted he have breakfast one morning and served up toast and marmalade. He took the jar to work with him and this contemporary classic was the result. This drink was the inspiration for the many variations on the preserve (jam/marmalade) theme that have followed in the decade since Salvatore stopped for 'proper' breakfast rather than just his usual swift espresso.<br /><br />
