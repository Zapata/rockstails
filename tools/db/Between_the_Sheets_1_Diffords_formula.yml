  Comment: "Classic proportions to this drink are most often quoted as being: 1 rum, 1 cognac, 1 triple sec and 1/4 lemon juice but three shots of 40% alcohol and a splash of lemon juice make for a tart drink which should not be undertaken lightly. The formula above maintains the essential flavour and ingredients of the classic recipe but is a little more approachable."
  Origin: Created in the early 1930s (during Prohibition) by Harry MacElhone of Harry's New York Bar in Paris, and derived from the Sidecar.
