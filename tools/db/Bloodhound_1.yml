  Comment: Looks like fruity disco drink fodder but is actually surprising dry and strong.
  Origin: Unknown but in his 1922 'Mixing Cocktails', Harry McElhone credits the Duke of Manchester with this drinks creation. However, in his 1907 'World Drinks', William Boothby lists a Bloodhound, as does Tom Bullock in his 1917 'The Ideal Bartender'.
  Variant: Made with strawberries in place of raspberries.
