  Comment: Now, I do like a juicy wally (gherkin) with my cod'n'chips but necking the brine in which they are packed is another thing. <br />Our American cousins have some strange habits - drive on the right, carry the ball when playing football and bowl underarm. <br />So these eccentricities should be remembered when I tell you that the drinking of cucumber brine is popular in New York City.
  Origin: " Created in 2006 at Brooklyn's Bushwick Country Club after the neighbouring business, McClure's Pickles, stored some of their pickles in the bar's basement. <br />Apparently this inspired bartender, Reggie Cunningham, to serve Old Crow Bourbon with a shot of McClure's spicy pickle brine. <br /><br />The Ruotolo brother took the drink to their Whiskey Town in New York's East Village with Jameson replacing the Bourbon.<br />"
