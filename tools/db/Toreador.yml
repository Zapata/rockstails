  Comment: Apricot brandy replaces triple sec in what otherwise follows the same recipe to a classic Margarita.
  Origin: This twist in the Margarita was published in W. J. Tarling's 1937 Cafe Royal Cocktail Book, 16 years before the first written reference to a Margarita. He also lists another drink called a Picador which is identical to the later Margarita.
