  Comment: The colour of this cocktail, due to sloe liqueur and grenadine, belies a surprisingly dry finish.
  Origin: This heralds from a classic cocktail known simply as the Millionaire. Originally Sloe gin was the main base ingredient, but David Embury once wrote, &quot;Since the sloe gin, which is a liqueur, predominates in this drink, I do not regard it as a true cocktail.&quot; Thus above is my modern adaptation.
