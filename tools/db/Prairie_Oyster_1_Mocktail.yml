  Comment: Like many supposed hangover cures, this works on the kill or cure basis. It tastes slightly better than it looks. <br /><br />
  Origin: Recipe adapted from Harry Craddock's 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book'. This drink is thought to have originally been created in Germany in the 1870s. Jeeves makes something similar for Bertie Wooster in a P.G. Wodehouse tale. <br /><br />
  Variant: Use another spirit such as vodka in place of cognac.
