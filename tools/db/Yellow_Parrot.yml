  Comment: The aniseed of the absinthe combines well with the other ingredients. A bit of a sweety but a strong old bird.
  Origin: Some say this was created in 1935 by Albert Coleman at The Stork Club, New York City, but the drink featured in Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Book five years before that.
