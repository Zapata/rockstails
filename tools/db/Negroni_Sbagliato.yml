  Comment: This light style Negroni has the bitterness but lacks the punch and character of the original.<br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE" />
  Origin: Pronounced 'spal-yacht-oh' which in Italian means 'mistake', this drink was created in the late 1980s by Mirko Stocchetti at his Bar Basso in Milan when making a Negroni he mistakenly reached for a bottle of spumante instead of gin. They are still served at Basso today in enormous chalice like glasses with single, giant, rectangular ice cube.<br />
