  Comment: Charles H. Baker says of this twist on a Sazerac, "Treat this one with the respect it deserves, gentleman.&quot;<br /><br />
  Origin: Adapted from a recipe by Charles H. Baker Junior. In his 1939 'The Gentleman's Companion' he writes of this drink, "a Hazy Memory of a Night in Havana during the Unpleasantnesses of 1933, when Each Swallow Was Punctuated with Bombs Going off on the Prado, or the Sound of 3" Shells Being Fired at the Hotel NACIONAL, then Haven for Certain Anti-Revolutionary Officers".<br />        <br />The drink is named after the press slogan, which allegedly provoked the 1898 Spanish-American War.<br /><br />
