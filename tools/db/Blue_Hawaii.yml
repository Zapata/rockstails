  Origin: Created in 1957 by Harry Yee at Henry Kaiser's Hawaiian Village Hotel (latterly the Hilton) in Waikiki, Oahu, Hawaii. The drink is named after the hit song from the 1937 Bing Crosby film, Waikiki Wedding, and not after what is generously described as a &quot;musical-comedy&quot; Elvis Presley 1961 film of the same name.
