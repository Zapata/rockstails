  Comment: " As Embury says, there would seem to be some sense in using a Scotch \r\n\
    based liqueur and although this version of the Bobby Burns is rarely \r\n\
    seen, it is worthy of a trial."
  Origin: Recipe adapted from David A. Embury's 1953 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', in which he writes of this drink, &quot;Peychaud, somehow seems to blend better than Angostura with the Scotch.&quot; &quot;Benedictine is sometimes used in place of Drambuie. However, the Drambuie is preferable because it is made with a Scotch whisky base.&quot;<br />
