  Comment: A slightly pink, dry, spicy long drink with rum and a hint of cloves and lime.
  Origin: This is the signature cocktail at Caf Adelaide's Swizzle Stick Bar, New Orleans, USA. There it is made with a liquid poured from a plain bottle marked 'top secret' but, having tried a drop, I think it is Falernum.
