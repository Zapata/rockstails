  Comment: Gin served chilled and neat, other than with a little dilution courtesy of melting ice. A great man but not necessarily a great drink. <br /><br />
  Origin: Legend has it that Sir Winston Churchill liked his Martinis served without the vermouth actually being added to the drink, just present in the same room. He is quoted as saying of the drink, "Glance at the vermouth bottle briefly while pouring the juniper distillate freely".<br /><br />
