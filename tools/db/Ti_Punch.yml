  Comment: "This drink only works with authentic agricole rum and sugar cane juice. On its native islands it is usual to use rhum blanc (unaged white agricole rum) during the day and rhum vieux (aged agricole rum) during the evening.<br /><br />Note: Traditionally the limes used to make this drink are not cut into slices or wedges. Instead a round disc is cut from the side of the fruit. These are cut large enough that some of the fruits pulp backs the peel on the disc. <br /><br /><br />"
  Origin: "Named Ti from the French word 'Petit', this is literally a small rum punch: unlike most rum punches, it is not lengthened with water or juice. It is popular in the French islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Runion and Maurice where it's often drunk straight down without adding ice and chased by a large glass of chilled water (called a 'crase' in Martinique ). These islands are also home to Rhum Agricole (a style of rum distilled only from sugar cane juice and usually bottled at 50% alc./vol.)<br /><br />"
