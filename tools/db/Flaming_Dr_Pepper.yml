  Comment: Please consider the likelihood of burning yourself while attempting to lift the flaming shot into the beer.
  Origin: So named as the end result resembles the taste of the proprietary Dr Pepper soft drink. This drink inspired an episode of The Simpsons featuring a similar drink titled the 'Flaming Homer' and later the 'Flaming Moe' (after the programme's bartender).
