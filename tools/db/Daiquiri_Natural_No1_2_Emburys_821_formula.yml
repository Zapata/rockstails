  Comment: Traditionally a Natural Daiquiri should always be based on light rum but if I should feel like breaking with tradition and using aged rum, I find Embury's 8:2:1 formula works particularly well.<br /><br />
  Origin: "According to David A. Embury's 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks' the classic proportions of a daiquiri are: 8 parts (2 shots) white label Cuban rum, 2 parts (1/2 shot) lime juice and 1 part (1/4 shot) sugar syrup. I have added the optional addition of water for increased dilution.<br /><br />"
