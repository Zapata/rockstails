  Comment: Great on a hot day, but the coldness masks much of the flavour evident when this drink is served 'up' or natural.
  Origin: Emilio Gonzalez is said to have first adapted the Natural Daiquiri into this frozen version at the Plaza Hotel in Cuba. However, Constantino Ribalaigua Vert of Havana's Floridita bar made the drink famous in 1912 and today the Floridita is known as 'the cradle of the Daiquiri'.
  Variant: With fruit.
