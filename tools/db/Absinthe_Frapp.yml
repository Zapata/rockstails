  Comment: Aniseed and the fire of absinthe moderated by sugar and ice but still a dangerous combination.
  Origin: Created in 1874 by Cayetano Ferrer at Aleix's Coffee House, New Orleans, which consequently became known as The Absinthe Room. Today the establishment is fittingly known as the Old Absinthe House but sadly US law prevents it from actually serving absinthe.
