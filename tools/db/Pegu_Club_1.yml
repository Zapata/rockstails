  Comment: I've added a dash of sugar to the original recipe to reduce the tartness of this gin based Margarita-like concoction.
  Origin: Created in the 1920s at the Pegu Club, an expat gentlemen's club in British colonial Rangoon, Burma. <br /><br />The recipe was first published in Harry MacElhone's 1927 'Barflies and Cocktails'.  In his seminal 1930 Savoy Cocktail, Harry Craddock notes of this drink, &quot;The favourite cocktail at the Pegu Club, Burma, and one that has travelled, and is asked for, round the world.&quot;
