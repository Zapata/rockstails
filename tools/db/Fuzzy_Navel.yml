  Comment: The hairy version is a slightly more interesting, drier, less fluffy concoction. So why have a fluffy navel when you can have a hairy one?
  Origin: A not very well regarded but extremely well known cocktail whose origins are lost.
  Variant: Hairy Navel with the addition of a shot of vodka.
