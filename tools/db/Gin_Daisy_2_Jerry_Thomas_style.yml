  Comment: The rich style of genever combines wonderfully with orange liqueur in this balanced classic.<br /><br /><br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE" />
  Origin: The origins of the Daisy are lost in time but the first written reference to it is in an 1866 novel called 'Gay Life in New York, or Fast Men and Grass Widows' by Henry Llewellyn Williams. This recipe is adapted from Jerry Thomas' 1876 'How to Mix Drinks'.<br /><br />
  Variant: Use almond (orgeat) syrup in place of sugar.
