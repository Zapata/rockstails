  Comment: A refreshing balance of sour lemon and sugar, laced with gin and lengthened with soda.
  Origin: In England, this drink is traditionally credited to John Collins, a bartender who worked at Limmer's Hotel, Conduit Street, London. The 'coffee house' of this hotel, a true dive bar, was popular with sporting types during the 19th century, and famous, according to the 1860s memoirs of a Captain Gronow, for its gin-punch as early as 1814.<br />    <br />John (or possibly Jim) Collins, head waiter of Limmer's, is immortalised in a limerick, which was apparently first printed in an 1892 book entitled 'Drinks of the World'. In 1891 a Sir Morell Mackenzie had identified John Collins as the creator of the Tom Collins, using this limerick, although both the words of the rhyme and the conclusions he drew from it were disputed. But, according to this version of the story, the special gin-punch for which John Collins of Limmer's was famous went on to become known as the Tom Collins when it was made using Old Tom gin.<br />        <br />The original Collins was probably based on genever gin, but there is also debate as to whether it was Old Tom or London Dry. To further complicate the issue a 'John Collins' appears to be exactly the same drink as a 'Tom Collins'. Thus I make a 'Collins' with genever gin, a 'Tom Collins' with old tom gin, and a 'John Collins' with London dry gin. Confused? Then you should also check out the 'Gin Punch' (which has the addition of bitters) and a 'Gin Fizz' which is topped with soda from a siphon.<br /><br />
