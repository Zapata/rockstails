  Comment: Pineapple and vanilla combine wonderfully. American readers may notice more than a passing resemblance to a Key Lime Pie served without the Graham Cracker rim.
  Origin: The drink Carrie and co discovered in the summer of 2003. In this series the Sex and the City stars dropped Cosmopolitans in favour of Hunks - no change there then.
