  Comment: Spicy, fruity tequila served in a style synonymous with the Crescent City - full on!
  Origin: "Adapted from a drink created in 2005 at Pirates Alley Caf, New Orleans, and named after the hurricane which devastated the city in 2005. The name is an acronym of its original ingredients: Kahla, Absinthe, Tequila,  Raspberry, Ice, Nutmeg and Apple juice."
