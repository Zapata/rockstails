  Comment: The name might be more masculine but it still tastes just like a classic Margarita
  Origin: Yes, you're right! This drink is exactly the same as a classically proportioned Margarita. It was published in W. J. Tarling's 1937 Cafe Royal Cocktail Book, 16 years before the first written reference to a Margarita. Conjecture suggests that this British recipe was copied by whichever American gave the Margarita its name?
