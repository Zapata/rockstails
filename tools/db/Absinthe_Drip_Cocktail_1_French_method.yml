  Comment: <p>Patience is a virtue. Slow dripping of the water is essential to dissolve the entire sugar cube and give the drink enough sweetness to balance the absinthe.</p>
  Origin: <p>This is the traditional method of serving absinthe. It was common until shortly before the First World War, when the drink was banned in most countries.</p>

ingredients: 
- - "1 1/2 "
  - shot
  - "La F\xE9e Parisienne (68%) absinthe"
- - "2"
  - shot
  - Chilled mineral water
- - "1"
  - cube
  - Granulated sugar
method: POUR absinthe into glass. PLACE cube of sugar on a slotted absinthe spoon resting across the top of the glass. Using a bottle of chilled mineral water with a small hole in the cap, DRIP water over the sugar so it dissolves and drips into the glass. Traditionally the same amount of sugar is added as water but I find full strength absinthe requires more dilution. Add ice, stir and serve.
