  Comment: Whichever of the two created the drink; it is Trader Vic that made it famous and it is his recipe that endures.
  Origin: It is claimed that Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt first served this drink in 1933 at his Don The Beachcomber's bar in Hollywood, California. This is some ten years earlier than Bergeron's Mai Tai-Roa A moment in cocktail history.
