    original Alexander, equal parts gin, cr`eme de cacao and cream, is thought to\r\n\
    have originated in the twentieth century, certainly before 1917. It became a\r\n\
    Prohibition favourite as the cream and nutmeg garnish helped disguise the rough\r\n\
    taste of homemade 'bathtub' gin.</span>"
