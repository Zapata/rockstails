  AKA: Gaelic Coffee
  Comment: Like most great ideas, this one is very simple. Coffee with a whiskey kick.<br /><br />
  Origin: This now ubiquitous cocktail was created in 1942 by Joe Sheridan, a bartender at Foynes airport (near the present-day Shannon airport). The majority of transatlantic flights used to stop to refuel in Ireland and in 1947 an American journalist, Stan Delaphane, found himself at Joe Sheridan's bar and tried his Irish Coffee. Delaphane was so impressed that on returning home he passed the recipe on to the bartender at his local bar, the Buena Vista Caf in San Francisco. The recipe spread and the drink became a classic.<br /><br />
  Variant: Sweeten with sugar syrup or liqueur to taste before floating cream.
