  AKA: Blue Devil
  Comment: More red than blue with a flavour that is reminiscent of a berry flavoured Aviation<br />
  Origin: Said to have been made circa 1940 by &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot;, this drink featured on the back label of the Creme Yvette bottles of the same era. This cocktail was lost for decades, due to production of Creme Yvette ceasing in 1969, but thanks to Creme Yvette's 2010 relauch, has been rediscovered. Incidentally, &quot;Blue Moon&quot; is an astronomical term for the second of two full moons to occur in the same calendar months. <br />
  Variant: Aviation<br />
