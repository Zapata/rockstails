  Comment: Innocuously light in both flavour and alcohol. Add a shot of triple sec and you are well on your way to making a Cosmopolitan.
  Origin: "Though to be the forerunner to the Cosmopolitan. A 1968 bottle label from Ocean Spray's archives lists the Harpoon as a &quot;new cocktail&quot;. It was originally launched as being 2 ounces Ocean Spray cranberry and 1 ounce vodka or light rum served &quot;over the rocks or tall with soda. Suggested garnish: a splash of lime or lemon optional.&quot; In 1970, it was updated to also list gin as a possible base spirit."
