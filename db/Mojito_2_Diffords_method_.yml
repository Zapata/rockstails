  Comment: All the flavour of the Mojito but without unattractive mint leaves trapped in crushed ice. This only works when fresh, cold crushed ice is used. Otherwise the drink will be overly diluted.<br /><br />
  Origin: Recipe by Yours Truly (Simon Difford), the man who likes his Mojito shaken and stirred.<br /><br />
