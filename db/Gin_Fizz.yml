  Comment: Everyone has heard of this clean, refreshing, long drink but few have actually tried it.<br /><br />
  Origin: A mid-19th century classic.<br /><br />
  Variant: With the addition of egg white this drink becomes a 'Silver Fizz'; with egg yolk it becomes a 'Golden Fizz'. A Royal Fizz includes one whole egg, a Diamond Fizz uses champagne instead of charged water, a Green Fizz has a dash of green cr√®me de menthe and a Purple Fizz uses equal parts of sloe gin and grapefruit juice in place of gin and lemon juice.<br /><br />
