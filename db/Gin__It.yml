  Comment: Simple but tasty combination of botanicals, wine and spirit.
  Origin: The name is short for 'Gin and Italian', a reference to the sweet vermouth, which was traditionally Italian while French vermouth was dry. In his 'Craft of the Cocktail', Dale DeGroff states that this drink was originally known as a 'Sweet Martini' and as such was a popular drink during the 1880s and 1890s at the Hoffman House and other New York bars. Later it became known as &quot;Gin &amp; Italian&quot;, until during/post Prohibition it was shortened to &quot;Gin &amp; It&quot;. <br /><br />
