  Comment: Like an ultra-smooth and complex Sweet Manhattan served on the rocks.
  Origin: Created in 1938 by Walter Bergeron, the then head bartender at what is now the Carousel bar at the Monteleone Hotel, New Orleans, USA. Pronounced 'Voo-Ka-Ray', it is named after the French term for New Orlean's French Quarter and literally translates as 'old square'.
