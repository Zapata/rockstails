  Comment: Bone dry but fresh and most definitely citrussy.<br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE" />
  Origin: Created at Chasen's, a legendary Hollywood restaurant that opened in 1936 and was a haunt of movie stars and even royalty until its eventual demise in 1995. The memorabilia that decorated the restaurant was held in storage and in 1997 Maud and Dave Chasen's grandson opened another Chasen's on Beverly Hills' Ca~non Drive which sadly failed due to a lack of patrons.<br />    <br />During the original Chasen's heyday its star-studded clientele enjoyed drinks created by its noted bartender Pepe Ruiz. Of these the Flame of Love is his most famous creation, partly due to its originally being made for Dean Martin. The legend of this drink is further embellished by Dean dragging his old pal Frank Sinatra to Chasen's to try the drink. The story goes that Frank was so impressed that he ordered one for everyone in the place.<br /><br />
