  Comment: "<p>Note: The so called 'dry shake' allows the cream and egg white to emulsify thus giving this drink its legendary silky mouth feel without the over dilution which would result from such a prolonged shake with ice.</p><br /><p>A delicate floral drink that is so creamy smooth that it is almost fluffy.</p><br />"
  Origin: <p>An adaptation of the Ramos Fizz. In his 1939 'the gentleman's Companion', Charles H. Baker Jr. credits this drinks creation to Ahmed Soliman a manufacturer and seller of Perfume Essences in the Khan el Kalili Bazaar, Cairo.</p><br />
  Variant: <p>Blend rather than shake.</p>
