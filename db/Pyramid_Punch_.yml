  Comment: Tangy, fruity and packed with flavour. Clove spice, fragrant floral pisco and elderflower with a hint of sweet pineapple and sour grapefruit.<br /><br />
  Origin: Simon Difford's 2006 adaptation of the Pisco Punch made famous before Prohibition at San Francisco's legendary Bank Exchange Bar. The Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper now stands on the site of The Bank Exchange, at the corner of Washington &amp; Montgomery Streets, hence this drink's name and garnish.<br /><br />
