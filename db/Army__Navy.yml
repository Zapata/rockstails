  Comment: Almond and lemon flavoured gin. Subtle, citrusy and dry.
  Origin: This old classic was originally made to an 8:4:4 formula but I have borrowed this 8:2:1 formula from David A. Embury's 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks' (he describes the original formulation as &quot;horrible&quot;). The addition of water is a Difford touch.
