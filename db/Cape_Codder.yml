  Comment: Dry and refreshing but not particularly interesting.
  Origin: Named after the resort on the Massachusetts coast. This fish shaped piece of land is where some of the first Europeans settled in the US. Here they found cranberries, the indigenous North American berry on which this drink is based.
  Variant: Without lime juice this is a Cape Cod. Lengthened with soda becomes the Cape Cod Cooler.
