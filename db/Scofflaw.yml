  Comment: This rust coloured drink is made or broken by the quality of the pomegranate syrup used.
  Origin: During the height of Prohibition The Boston Herald ran a competition asking readers to coin a new word for &quot;a lawless drinker of illegally made or illegally obtained liquor&quot;. Out of 25,000 entries, 'Scofflaw' was chosen and on 15th January 1924 the $200 prize was shared between two people who had submitted the word. This cocktail was created Jock at Harry's American Bar, Paris, to celebrate the new term.
