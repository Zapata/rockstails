  Comment: This fruit laced mix is neither too sweet, nor too strong. It is perfect. <br /><br />
  Origin: Probably the most famous of all punch recipes, this originated in 1732 at a Philadelphia fishing and social club called the 'State in Schuylkill'. As a punch the original was mixed in larger quantities and served from a punch bowl. <br />Many modern variations use soda water (club soda) in place of mineral water. The inclusion of peach liqueur is a modern substitute for the traditional peach brandy. However, it's believed the Schuylkill original omitted peach entirely.<br /><br />
