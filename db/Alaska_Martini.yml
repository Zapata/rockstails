  Origin: In his 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book', Harry Craddock writes, &quot;so far as can be ascertained this delectable potion is NOT the staple diet of the Esquimaux. It was probably first thought of in South Carolina - hence its name.&quot; The addition of dry sherry is recommended in David Embury's 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'.
