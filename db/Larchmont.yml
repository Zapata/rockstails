  Comment: I share Embury's appreciation of this fine drink, although I think of it more as a type of Orange Daiquiri.
  Origin: "Created by David A. Embury, who in his 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks' writes of this drink: &quot;As a grand finale to cocktails based on the Rum Sour, I give you one of my favorites which I have named after my favorite community&quot;."
