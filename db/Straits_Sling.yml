  Comment: Dry cherry and gin come to the fore in this long refreshing drink.
  Origin: Thought to be the original name of the Singapore Sling. Conjecture, partly based on a reference to 'Kirsch' in Embury's Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, has it that the drink was originally based on cherry eau de vie and not the cherry liqueur used in most Singapore Sling recipes today.
