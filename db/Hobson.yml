  Comment: Unbalanced towards sweetness. With drinks like this you can see why Hobson chose to be an abstainer. Originally served 'straight-up' but better over crushed ice.<br /><br />
  Origin: Named after Richmond Pearson Hobson (1870-1937) the United States Navy Rear Admiral and not Thomas Hobson (1545-1631) from Cambridge, England who gave rise to the term 'Hobson's choice'. R.P. Hopson was a hero of the American-Spanish war of 1898 who went on to became a Congressman. An ardent abstainer, Hobson has been called 'The Father of American Prohibition' due of his advocacy for criminalizing alcohol and other drugs and was a prolific author on this subject.<br /><br />
