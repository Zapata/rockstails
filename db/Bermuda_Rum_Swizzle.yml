  Comment: Your five-a-day fruits in a glass, laced with pungent rums and clove infused Falernum.
  Origin: This recipe is adapted from one by Del Pedro, originally from Bermuda but now resident in New York City. It came my way (in 1997) courtesy of the dangerously sexy LeNell Smothers, and apparently it originally heralds from the Swizzle Inn in Bermuda where their rather appropriate slogan is &quot;Swizzle Inn, Swagger Out&quot;.<br /><br />
