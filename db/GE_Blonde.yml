  Comment: This delicate drink demands freshly pressed apple juice and flavoursome Scotch with subtle peat.
  Origin: A combined effort by the staff of London's GE Club in January 2002, this was named by Linda, a waitress at the club who happens to be blonde. She claimed the name was inspired by the cocktail's straw colour.
