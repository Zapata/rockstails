  Comment: A ginger influenced Aviation named after fictional flying heroes. The ginger used in Canton's liqueur is also sourced from Borneo. How neat.
  Origin: Created in 2008 by Simon Difford at the Cabinet Room, London, England. Named after the adventures of 'Biggles in Borneo' in which wartime flying heroes Ginger, Algy and Biggles battle the Japanese in the jungle.
