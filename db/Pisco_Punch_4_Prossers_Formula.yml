  Comment: An aromatic take on the Pisco Punch.
  Origin: "Jack Koeppler, the bartender at the Buena Vista Caf in San Francisco who's also famous for being the first bartender in America to serve Irish Coffee, was given this recipe by the son of it's creator, a fellow San Franciscan by the name of Mr Prosser. I've adapted this recipe from his, which originally comprised: 2 shots white grape juice, 2 shots pisco, 1 spoon pineapple juice and 1 spoon absinthe."
