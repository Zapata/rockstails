  Comment: The key to this drink is serving it ice cold and giving the flavours in the<br />mint time to marry with the spirit. Hence, Juleps are ideally prepared hours in advance of serving. Adjust sugar to balance if using a fortified wine in place of a spirit.
  Origin: Juleps are tall drinks generally served in Collins glasses but originally served in julep cups and based on a spirit, liqueur or fortified wine. They are most often served with fresh mint over crushed ice.<br />        <br />The name ultimately derives from the Arabic word 'julab', meaning rosewater. Although this had been used to describe any sweetened drink, up to and including medicines. The Julep is thought to have originated in Persia, or there abouts, and it travelled to Europe (some say Southern France) where the rose petals were substituted for indigenous mint. The drink is then believed to have crossed the Atlantic where cognac was replaced with peach brandy and then whiskey - the Mint Julep we recognise today.<br />        <br />The first known written reference to a cocktail-style Julep was by a Virginian gentleman in 1787.<br /><br />
