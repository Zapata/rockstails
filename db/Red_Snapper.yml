  Comment: Looks like a Bloody Mary but features gin's aromatic botanicals.<br /><br />
  Origin: "Today, the term Red Snapper means a Bloody Mary made with gin instead of vodka. But the first known recipes, from the 1940s, describe a 50-50 blend of vodka and tomato juice, with spices, just like an early Bloody Mary: one book even states that the Red Snapper is identical to the Bloody Mary.<br />        <br />Cocktail lore states that the Bloody Mary was officially renamed the Red Snapper at the St. Regis Hotel, at some point after the fabulously wealthy Vincent Astor bought it in 1935. Fernand Petiot, who most likely created the original drink (see 'Bloody Mary'), was working there, but Astor apparently found the title too crude for his clientele and insisted the drink be renamed. Customers, of course, continued to order Bloody Marys, but the Red Snapper found a drink of its own in due course.<br /><br />"
