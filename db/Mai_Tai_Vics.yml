  Comment: I love Daiquiris and this is basically a classic Daiquiri with a few bells and whistles.<br /><br />
  Origin: In 1934, Victor Jules Bergeron, or Trader Vic as he became known, opened his first restaurant in Oakland, San Francisco. He served Polynesian food with a mix of Chinese, French and American dishes cooked in wood-fired ovens. But he is best known for the rum based cocktails he created.<br />       <br />One evening in 1944 he tested a new drink on two friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild. After the first sip, Carrie exclaimed, &quot;Mai Tai-Roa A&quot;, which in Tahitian means 'Out of this world - the best!'. So Bergeron named his drink the Mai Tai.<br />       <br />The original was based on 17 year old Jamaican J.Wray &amp; Nephew rum which Vic in his own guide describes as being "surprisingly golden in colour, medium bodied, but with the rich pungent flavour particular to the Jamaican blends". Vic states he used "rock candy" syrup, an old term for the type of strong sugar syrup I prescribe in this guide. The term referred to the fact that you could dangle a piece of string in it to encourage crystallisation and make rock candy.<br />       <br />When supplies of the Jamaican 17-year-old rum dwindled, Vic started using a combination of dark Jamaican rum and Martinique rum to achieve the desired flavour. Sheer demand in his chain of restaurants later necessitated the introduction of a Mai Tai pre-mix (still available from www.tradervics.com).<br />       <br />Others, particularly Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt, then owner of a Hollywood bar called Don the Beachcomber's, have also laid claim to the creation of this drink. But as Vic says in his own Bartender's Guide, "Anybody who says I didn't create this drink is a dirty stinker." This recipe is adapted from Victor Bergeron's 'Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide' (1972 revised edition).<br /><br />
