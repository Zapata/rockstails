  Comment: Elderflower liqueur mellows and boosts floral notes in the cognac with the merest dash of absinthe dries and adds a robust hint of aniseed.<br /><br />
  Origin: Created in 2006 by Simon Difford at The Cabinet Room, London, England. The name references the fact that St-Germain is a district of Paris on the left bank of the River Seine and absinthe was banned in Paris, partly because it was believed to induce insanity.  <br /><br />
