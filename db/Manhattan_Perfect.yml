  Comment: The Manhattan version most popularly served - medium dry.
  Origin: Whatever the truth of its invention (see Manhattan Dry), the Manhattan was probably originally made with rye whiskey, rather than bourbon, as New York was a rye-drinking city, although early bar books just state 'whiskey'. Today it is common to use bourbon, although purists are beginning to revive rye.<br />       <br />When Scotch is substituted for bourbon the Manhattan becomes a Rob Roy, with brandy (cognac) it becomes a Harvard and with applejack it is a Star Cocktail when made with applejack.<br />    <br />Some time in 2005 it became conventional in some New York bars to garnish a Manhattan with two cherries as a 9/11 tribute.<br /><br />
  Variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Sweet. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned glass.<br /><br />
