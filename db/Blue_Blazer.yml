ingredients: 
- - "4"
  - shot
  - Johnnie Walker Scotch Whisky
- - "4"
  - shot
  - Boiling water
- - "1"
  - spoon
  - Granulated sugar
method: WARNING - do not attempt to make this drink. If you really must, then please practice with water first to perfect your method, stand on a non-flammable floor, have suitable fire fighting equipment and preferably a medical professional nearby. You will need two large silver-plated mugs with handles. Preheat the mugs with boiling water and warm the whisky. POUR the whisky into one mug and fresh boiling water into the other. Ignite the whiskey using a long match and while still blazing pour the whisky into the other mug. Then mix ingredients by pouring them from one mug to the other. The foolhardy increase the distance between the mugs as they pour, thus creating a spectacular long blue flame between the two mugs. Extinguish flame by covering mug, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powered sugar.<br /><br />
