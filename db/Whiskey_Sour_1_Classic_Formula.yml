  Comment: I find the classic formulation more sweet than sour and prefer the 4:2:8 ratio.
  Origin: This recipe follows the classic sour proportions (3:4:8) three quarter part of the sour ingredient (lemon juice)one part of the sweet ingredient (sugar syrup) and two parts of the strong ingredient (whiskey).
