  Comment: Fantastically herbal with hints of apple, mint and eucalyptus. This classic is often made with green Chartreuse - I prefer mine with half yellow and half green and dare I say shaken.<br /><br />
  Origin: Created before 1895 by George Kappeler at New York City's Holland House. <br /><br />
