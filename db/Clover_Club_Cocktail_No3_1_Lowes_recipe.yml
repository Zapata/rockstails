  AKA: With a mint leaf garnish this drink called a 'Clover Leaf'.
  Comment: Balanced and complex with a fruity blast of raspberry - made interesting due to its inclusion of vermouth.<br /><br /><br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE" />
  Origin: Recipe from 1909 Drinks - How to Mix and Serve, by Paul E. Lowe and courtesy of Dave Wondrich who says this is the earliest Clover Club recipe he has discovered. Lowe omits the lemon juice in his original recipe but this is thought to be a mistake. Albert Stevens Crockett credits the creation of this cocktail to the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, Philadelphia in his 1931 'Old Waldorf Bar Days'.<br /><br /><br />
