  Comment: A subtle hint of biscuity champagne shines through this very quaffable drink.
  Origin: There are many versions of this classic cocktail but I have taken this one from Dale DeGroff's 2008 'The Essential Cocktail' where Dale credits this recipe to the Ritz Bar Paris circa 1936.<br /><br />
