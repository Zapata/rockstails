  Comment: There is much debate among bartenders as to whether granulated sugar or sugar syrup and if brown or white sugar should be used when making this drink. Those who favour granulated sugar argue that muddling with the abrasive crystals helps extract the oils from the lime's skin. Personally, I hate the crunch of sugar as inevitably not all the granulated sugar dissolves. Whether you should use brown or white sugar to make your syrup is another question. I prefer mine made the way it is in its native Brazil, with white sugar.<br /><br />
  Origin: In its native Brazil it is usual to serve this drink with cubed ice but the drink travelled to the UK at a time when the use of crushed ice was fashionable and so in this and other 'new' cachaca markets use of crushed ice has become the norm. <br /><br />
