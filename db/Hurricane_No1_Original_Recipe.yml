  Comment: The flavour of the passion fruit syrup predominates. Ok if you like that kind of thing.<br /><br />
  Origin: Recipe adapted from Jeff Berry's 1998 'Beachbum Berry's Grog Log' and purported to be the 1960s recipe used at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans. The recipe was adapted to a rum and juice combination where it was served in 1939 at the World's Fair in New York at the Hurricane bar.<br /><br />
