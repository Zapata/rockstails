  Comment: Smoother, lighter and easier than most classic cocktails - perhaps a little too much so.
  Origin: Adapted from a recipe in the 1930 edition of the Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock. The original recipe called for equal parts, including the<br />bitters - surely a mistake.
  Variant: Substitute Angostura aromatic bitters for peach bitters.
