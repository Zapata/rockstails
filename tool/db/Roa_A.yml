  Comment: Not quite the best, but this long, fruity thurst quencher isn't half bad.
  Origin: Discovered in 2003 at Booly Mardy's, Glasgow, Scotland.  Cocktail aficionados will be familiar with the Tahitian phase 'Mai Tai - Roa A', or 'out of this world - the best', which gave Mai Tai it's names. This cocktail means simply 'the best'.
