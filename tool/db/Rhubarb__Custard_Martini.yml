  Comment: As sharp, sweet, creamy and flavourful as the dessert it imitates.
  Origin: I created this drink in 2002. Rhubarb and Custard is a great British dessert and was a cult children's TV cartoon in the 1970s. It featured a naughty pink can called Custard and a dog named Rhubarb who, like many British men, spent a lot of time in his garden shed.
