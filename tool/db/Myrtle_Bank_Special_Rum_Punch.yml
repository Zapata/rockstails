  Origin: Originally made at the Myrtle Bank Hotel, Kingston, Jamaica. Built in the mid-1800s, the Myrtle Bank, was converted from a shipyard into a select boarding house. After the hotel was destroyed in the 1907 earthquake it was reconstructed in 1918 and was then the largest hotel in Jamaica with 205 rooms and a filtered salt water pool.<br /><br />
