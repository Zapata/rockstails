  AKA: Diamond Martini
  Comment: Dilution is achieved as the water you have frozen in the glass begins to melt. Both glass and gin must be freezing cold so that the temperature masks the strength of the alcohol. You have been warned!<br /><br />
  Origin: After the Second World War, vermouth proportions in the classic Dry Martini dropped rapidly, and this 'Naked' style of serve began to appear. Tradionally both vermouth and gin had been stirred with ice. In a Naked Martini the merest hint of vermouth is swirled around a well-chilled glass and then frozen gin is poured into the vermouth-coated glass. <br />        <br />The trick to a good Naked Martini is still achieving some dilution by the addition of a splash of water in the glass before freezing. This is a trick I learnt from Salvatore Calabrese, who originally tended bar at London's Duke's Hotel - famous for its Dry Martinis.<br /><br />
  Variant: Use an atomiser to coat glass with vermouth. Based on vodka.
