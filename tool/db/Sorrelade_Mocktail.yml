  Comment: Sorrelade looks a little like cranberry juice and like cranberry juice has a bittersweet, slightly spicy taste.
  Origin: Jamaican sorrel, also known by it's scientific name 'Hibiscus Sabdariffa', is a plant propagated for its red petals. In Jamaica these are used to make this refreshing drink. (Jamaican sorrel is not related to the English Garden herb of the same name.)
