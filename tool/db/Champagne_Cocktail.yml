  Comment: An over hyped classic cocktail that gets sweeter as you reach the dissolving cube at the bottom.<br /><br />
  Origin: First recorded in Jerry Thomas's 1862 book 'How To Mix Drinks', or 'The Bon Vivant's Companion', where he almost certainly mistakenly specifies this as a shaken drink. That would be explosive. Another early reference to Champagne cocktails is in Mark Twain's 1869 novel, Innocents Abroad. It is thought the drink found popularity after a bartender named John Dougherty won an 1899 New York cocktail competition with a similar drink named Business Brace.<br /><br />
