  Comment: A Sweet Manhattan made with Scotch in place of Bourbon. The dry, peaty whisky and bitters ensure it's not too sweet.
  Origin: Created in 1894 at New York's Waldorf - Astoria Hotel (the Empire State Building occupies the site today) and named after the Broadway show that was showing at the time.
  Variant: "'Highland', made with orange bitters instead of Angostura."
