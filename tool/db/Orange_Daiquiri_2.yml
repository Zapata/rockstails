  Comment: Crole Shrubb is an unusual liqueur made my infusing orange peel in casks of mature Martinique rum.
  Origin: I conceived this drink in 1998, after visiting the company which was then importing Crole Shrubb. I took a bottle to London's Met Bar and Ben Reed made me my first Orange Daiquiri.
  Variant: Derby Daiquiri
