  Comment: This champagne cocktail is fortified with bourbon and orange liqueur.
  Origin: Created circa 1917 and named after its place of origin, the Seelbach Hotel, 500 South 4th Street, Louisville, Kentucky, USA. The Old Seelbach Bar bar has been restored to its authentic, early 1900s decor and continues to serve its signature drink to this day. Gary Regan once described the expansive bourbon selection stocked on the bar back here as &quot;one of the finest stretches of mahogany in the country.&quot; If visiting the Seelbach be sure to check out the beautiful tiled function room with its vaulted ceiling in the basement.<br />
