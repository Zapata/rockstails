  Comment: Grapefruit and maraschino balance each other in the gin based classic.
  Origin: Created during the Prohibition period at New York's Colony speakeasy, possibly by bartender Marco Hattem. The Colony attracted an upmarket Clientele, including the Vanderbilts and Windsors. The liquor was kept in an elevator which would be sent to either that attic or the basement if federal agents raided.
