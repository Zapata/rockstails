  Comment: Two traditional punches remain on today's cocktail lists, the 'Rum Punch' and the 'Hot Whisky Punch', now better known as the 'Hot Toddy'. Also bear in mind that the Gin Punch probably led to the creation of the Collins.<br /><br /><br />
  Origin: |-
    Long before the Martini, the V-shaped glass and the cocktail shaker,
    the drink of choice at society gatherings was punch and the punch bowl
    was the centre of activity at every party.<br />
    <br />
    Punch had existed in India for centuries before colonialists brought it
    back to Europe some time in the latter half of the 1600s. The name
    derives from the Hindi word for five, 'panch', and refers to the five
    key ingredients: alcohol, citrus, sugar, water and spices.<br />
    <br />In India, it was made with arrack (the Arabic word for liquor and a
    local spirit distilled from palm sap or sugar cane). Back in Britain it
    was common for punches to be spiced with nutmeg or tea.<br />
            <br />
    The classic proportions of a punch follow a mnemonic, 'one of sour, two
    of sweet, three of strong and four of weak.' It refers to lime juice,
    sugar, rum and water - the fifth element, spice was added to taste.<br />
            <br />
    The basic punch principle of balancing sweet and sour with spirit and
    dilution remains key to making a good cocktail to this day. Indeed, the
    essential punch ingredients - spirit, citrus, sugar and water - lie at
    the centre of most modern day cocktails including the Daiquiri, Sour,
    Margarita, Caipirinha and Sidecar. Today's bartenders are now also
    reintroducing the fifth punch ingredient by muddling or macerating
    herbs and spices in their cocktails.<br />
