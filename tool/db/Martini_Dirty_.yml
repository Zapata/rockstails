garnish: Olive on stick
glass: Martini
infos: 
  AKA: F.D.R. Martini after the american president Frankin Delano Roosevelt.
  Comment: "This drink varies from delicious to disgusting, depending on the liquid in your jar of olives. Oil will provide a revolting emulsion: make sure that your olives are packed in brine."
  Origin: "Some attribute the creation of this drink to Roosevelt: the 32nd president was a keen home bartender, although his cocktails were reportedly 'horrendous' and there is no evidence that he used olive brine in his Martinis."
  Variant: Substitute vodka for gin.
