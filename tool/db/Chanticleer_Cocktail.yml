  Comment: "Wonderfully aromatic orange with a complex balance of gin and vermouth. "
  Origin: Recipe adapted from A.S. Crockett's 1935, The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book which originally calls for 'orange gin' rather than using an orange liqueur. Crockett handily says of this drink, &quot;Add a Cock's Comb if desired.&quot; He     also explains that the drink &quot;Celebrated the local opening of Edmond Rostand's     Chanticler&quot;. Edmond Rostand was a French poet and dramatist, best-known for his     play Cyrano de Bergerac. First released in 1910, Chantecler (correct spelling)     is a story where the characters are based on barnyard animals, and whose     eponymous protagonist is a rooster who believes that his song makes the sun     rise.<br />By all accounts the cocktail is     rather better than the play. Incidentally, the 'Chantecler' is actually a breed     of chicken developed in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century by Brother Wilfred     Chantelain, a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka Canada
