  Comment: One of the great classic cocktails. The perfect balance of sweet and sour is enhanced by the incredibly smooth, almost fluffy mouth feel.<br /><br />
  Origin: This was the secret recipe of Henry C. Ramos, who opened his Imperial Cabinet Bar in New Orleans in 1888. At the onset of Prohibition his brother, Charles Henry Ramos, published it in a full-page advertisement, and since 1935, the Roosevelt (now named the Fairmont) Hotel, New Orleans, has held the trademark on the name Ramos Gin Fizz.<br />    <br />To make a more traditional style of Ramos Gin Fizz try using full fat milk in place of cream and shake until bubbles disappear.<br /><br />
