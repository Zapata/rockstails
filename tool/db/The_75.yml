  Comment: Hardened palates will appreciate this fantastically dry, aromatic and complex cocktail.
  Origin: Like the French 75, this was named after the celebrated 75, a French 75mm field gun developed during the 1890s and used by the French army during the First World War and beyond. The gun was unusually lethal due to its fast rate of fire.
