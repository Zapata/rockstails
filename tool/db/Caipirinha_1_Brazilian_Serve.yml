  Comment: You are probably used to this drink being served with crushed ice but until you have tried it with cubed ice you have not really tried a Caipirinha.<br /><br />
  Origin: Pronounced 'Kie-Pur-Reen-Yah', the name of this traditional Brazilian cocktail literally translates as 'little countryside drink'. It is made by muddling green lemons known as 'limon subtil', which are native to Brazil (limes are the best substitute when these are not available), and mixing with sugar and cachaca. Be sure to muddle in a sturdy, non-breakable glass.     <br /><br />In Britain and other 'new' cachaca markets it is common practice to serve this drink with crushed ice but in Brazil it is usually served with cubed ice. Capirinhas and variations on the theme are staples in cachacerias, traditional Brazilian bars which specialise in cachaca.<br /><br />
