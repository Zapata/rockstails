  Comment: A classic frozen Daiquiri heavily laced with maraschino cherry.
  Origin: This was one of the two cocktails with which I won a Havana Club Daiquiri competition in 2002. I named it after Girolamo Luxardo, creator of the now famous liqueur, 'Luxardo Maraschino'. My educated sub also informs me Lux is Latin for light.
