  Comment: A Daiquiri No.1 with a tang of grapefruit and hint of maraschino. Essentially a Hemingway Special Daiquiri (Papa Doble Daiquiri) for folk without the great author's constitution or love of the sours.<br /><br />
  Origin: Thought to have been created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert at the Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba, circa 1915. If this was invented as early as 1915, then this was the predecessor of the Hemingway Daiquiri, since Hemingway did not arrive in Cuba until 1928.<br /><br />
