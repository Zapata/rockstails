  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The Bacardi Cocktail originated in Cuba in 1917 and quickly grew in popularity
    with the growth of the cocktail culture in the USA after prohibition, so much
    so that it became known simply as 'the Bacardi'. There are two schools of thought
    over the original ingredients - some believe it was originally simply a Daiquiri,
    containing rum, lime juice, and sugar but made using Bacardi rum and that the
    now ubiquitous grenadine version originated in New York sometime after Prohibition.
    However, others hold that the grenadine was there at conception - after all there
    is no doubt that the Daiquiri was originally made with Bacardi rum. However, the
    number of vintage cocktails books listing a Bacardi Cocktail without grenadine
    would seem to back up the inclusion of grenadine being a later addition.Like the
    Daiquiri, The Bacardi Cocktail was sometimes served frozen and talking about this
    special iced version, Jack Doyle, former barman at Sloppy Joe's in Key West, then
    Bacardi Imports Inc. barman in New York, explained, 'The secret to the iced version
    was to shake the flaked iced until it looked like sherbet.' This technique became
    known as frappe. As the Bacardi Cocktail rapidly grew in popularity a small number
    of establishments neglected to use Bacardi rum as the base ingredient, despite
    the brand being fundamental to the drinks name and taste. In 1936 this led the
    Bacardi Company to take the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel and the Wivel Restaurant in West
    Fifty-Fourth Street to court in New York City to ensure that when a customer asked
    for 'Bacardi' by name they were given Bacardi Rum, so protecting the company's
    trademark. Bacardi's case at New York's Supreme Court involved the premise that
    theirs was a unique rum and Bacardi family members travelled from Cuba to New
    York to appear as witnesses. Even Enrique Schueg, the third President of the Bacardi
    Company, took to the witness stand. When asked by Justice Walsh, 'Well, how is
    this Bacardi Rum of yours made?' he replied, 'Oh! That is my secret.' Despite
    this secrecy, after deliberation, Justice John L. Walsh eventually affirmed that

    Cocktail must legally be made with rum manufactured by the Compania Ron Bacardi.

  comment: Serve with breakfast cereal and you'll be set up for the day. The high
    fresh banana content means this drink will quickly turn brown if left. This can
    be countered by adding fresh lemon juice and balancing with more honey but this
    detracts from the fresh banana flavour.

  comment: Orange always works when mixed with cognac and here Dubonnet also tames

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: "This cocktail is named after Barney Barnato, who was born Barnett Issacs
    in 1852 in the Whitechapel slum of London and traded on his Jewish-Cockney wit
    and humour. With only a box of cigars to his name, in 1873 Barney fled poverty
    to join his brother in the South African diamond rush and changed his name. He
    formed the Barnato Diamond Mining Company and within ten years he had become a
    millionaire. He and his brother were eventually forced to sell out to Cecil John
    Rhodes for lb5,338,650, then the single largest cheque that had been written.
    The fortune was little compensation for being beaten in the battle to control
    the Cape diamond mines - Rhodes went on to form the now mighty De Beers.\tAfter
    a brief spell in South African politics Barnato died in 1897 when he was lost
    overboard near the island of Madeira, whilst on a passage home to England. It
    is still questioned as to whether he jumped, fell or was pushed. His body was
    recovered but the mysterious circumstances of his death were never resolved. He
    is buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery, London.\tHis vast fortune was divided
    between his family, including his sister Sarah and her husband Abraham Rantzen,
    great-grandparents of TV presenter Esther Rantzen. Another beneficiary was his
    son, Woolf Barnato, who used part of this inheritance to become one of the so-called
    Bentley Boys racing drivers in the 1920s.\tThis recipe is adapted from Harry Craddock's
    1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book' which calls for a now defunct South African product
    called Caperitif. I have used Dubonnot Red in its place, but some consider white
    vermouth or aromatized wine a better substitute."

  comment: It's hard not to like this blend of peaches and sparkling wine.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: It has long been traditional in Italy to marinade fresh peaches in wine
    and the Bellini draws on this tradition, combining prosecco wine with pured white
    peaches. Giuseppe Cipriani created this drink at Harry's Bar, Venice, in 1945,
    fourteen years after he opened his tiny place on the edge of the Grand Canal,
    not far from St. Mark's Square. Cipriani named his cocktail after the 15th-century
    Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini due to the drink's pink hue and the painter's
    penchant for using rich pinks on his canvases.Like many other legendary bars around
    the world, Harry's owes some of its notoriety to being patronised by probably
    the world's greatest drinker, Ernest Hemingway. It was also the haunt of Sinclair
    Lewis, Orson Welles, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Dorothy Parker, and continues to
    attract celebrities to this day. But you don't have to be a celebrity to go to
    Harry's Bar. Cocktail aficionados from around the world make pilgrimages to the
    birthplace of the Bellini to sample the original recipe.White peaches are in season
    in Italy from May to September, so in Venice those bars that insist on only using
    fresh peaches rather than frozen puree sell the drink between May and October.

  origin: 'This vintage layered, or ''pousse-caf'' style, drink is named after the
    French for ''jewel'', apparently a reference to its trio of ingredients having
    the colours of the three most precious jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth)
    and emerald (Green Chartreuse). If all the ingredients, and so the colours, are
    shaken together the result is a rather better, aptly named drink called the Amber
    Dream. I wouldn''t ponce about making this layered drink. Grab a shaker and enjoy
    an Amber Dream.'

  comment: Full-flavoured stout and delicate champagne are an unlikely combination
    but this classic has stood the test of time. Some may wish to add a barspoon of
    sugar syrup.
  aka: Bismark
  variant: If porter is used instead of stout, this drink becomes simply a Velvet.
    If beer is used, it is known as the Halstead Street Velvet.
  origin: Thought to have originated in 1861 at Brook's Club, London although some
    credit some credit the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin, Ireland. What is certain is that
    this drink was created at the time when Britain was morning the death of HRH Prince
    Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. The Black Velvet is often served to commemorate
    Saint Patrick's Day but is more fittingly served on 14 December as this is the
    day Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in 1861. Devastated, the Queen wore black
    for the rest of her life so this drink's shrouding of champagne is most appropriate.
    In his 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', David A. Embury writes of this drink,
    "I was first introduced to Black Velvet at the home of a very dear friend of mine
    in Montreal and I received one of the greatest of all the drinking surprises of
    my whole life. The combination of champagne and stout sounds terrifying - something
    like molasses and horseradish. Actually, its excellent. The champagne cuts the
    heavy, syrupy consistency of the stout, and the stout takes the sharp, tart edge
    off the champagne. Each is the perfect complement of the other. Be sure, however,
    that you use (a) a good bottle of stout, (b) an extra-dry champagne - preferably
    a brut or nature."

  comment: The classic brunch cocktail.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The creation of The Bloody Mary is a matter of some dispute, but is generally
    credited to Fernand Petiot. Whether this was in 1920 (or 1921), when Petiot was
    a young bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, or in America, during the
    1940s, after the comedian George Jessel had first popularised the unspiced combination
    of vodka and tomato juice, is not clear.If you believe that Petiot first created
    it around 1920, then you will believe that the name is borrowed not from the English
    Queen Mary I, whose persecution of Protestants gave her that name, or for the
    silent movie actress Mary Pickford, but from one of Petiot's customers, apparently
    the entertainer Roy Barton. He had worked at a nightclub (or knew a bar) called
    the Bucket of Blood in Chicago, where there was a waitress known as 'Bloody Mary',
    and he said the drink reminded him of her.If you believe Petiot invented it in
    New York, where he worked at the St. Regis Hotel certainly from the end of Prohibition,
    then he may have had assistance in its creation from Serge Obolansky, the manager
    of the hotel, who asked him to spice up his 50-50 blend of vodka and tomato juice.
    According to this version, he attempted to rename the drink Red Snapper, after
    Vincent Astor, who owned the hotel, found the name too crude for his clientele.
    (now days a Red Snapper is a Bloody Mary made with gin.) The celery stick garnish
    apparently dates back to 1960 when a bartender at the Ambassador Hotel in Chicago
    noticed a lady stirring her drink with a celery stick. Whatever the precise story
    behind this fantastic drink, Bloody Mary recipes are as personal as Martinis.
    Purists will only use Tabasco, Worcestershire sauce, salt and lemon to spice up
    tomato and vodka but everything from oysters to V8 can be added. Variations include:Asian
    Mary (with wasabi, ginger &amp; soy sauce)Bloody Bull (with beef consomm)Bloody
    Caesar (with clam juice)Bloody Joseph (with Scotch whisky)Bloody Maria (with tequila)Bloody
    Maru (with sake)Bloody Shame (without alcohol)Bullshot (with beef bouillon)Cubanita
    (with rum)Red Snapper (with gin)

  method: WARNING - do not attempt to make this drink. If you really must, then please
    practice with water first to perfect your method, stand on a non-flammable floor,
    have suitable fire fighting equipment and preferably a medical professional nearby.
    You will need two large silver-plated mugs with handles. Preheat the mugs with
    boiling water and warm the whisky. POUR the whisky into one mug and fresh boiling
    water into the other. Ignite the whiskey using a long match and while still blazing
    pour the whisky into the other mug. Then mix ingredients by pouring them from
    one mug to the other. The foolhardy increase the distance between the mugs as
    they pour, thus creating a spectacular long blue flame between the two mugs. Extinguish
    flame by covering mug, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powered
    sugar.

    adapted from Harry Craddock's 1930, The Savoy Cocktail Book which calls for equal
    parts vermouth and Scotch with three dashes of Bénédictine. Craddock writes of
    this drink, ?One of the very best Whisky Cocktails. A very fast mover on Saint
    Andrew?s Day.?This drink is named after and commemorates Robert Burns (1759?1796):
    poet, balladeer and Scotland's favourite son. On the 25th January Scots honour
    the great man's presumed birthday on what has become known as Burn?s Night with
    poem readings, the ritualistic serving of haggis and a few drams."

    Albert Stevens Crockett's 1931 'The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book' where the drink
    is listed as 'Robert Burns' accompanied by the following notation, \"It may have
    been named after the celebrated Scotsman. Chances are, however, that it was christened
    in honour of a cigar salesman, who \"bought\" in the Old Bar [at the Waldorf-Astoria].\"
    Cocktail historian, Gaz Regan discovered that in the 1923 edition of Valentine's
    Manual of Old New York, a book edited by Henry Collins Brown, there is a picture
    with the following description &quot;The island plot at corner of Forty-second
    Street and Broadway in 1880, now occupied by the 'Times' building, after the demolition
    of the Pabst restaurant and brownstone houses.&quot; The scene includes billboards
    advertising Bergen Beach, the Castle Square Opera Company, and the Lyceum Theatre,
    which was playing The Moth and the Flame at the time but as Gaz points out, \"Most
    interesting, though, is the shop that stands in the foreground of the picture.
    The words on the awning proclaim, Robert Burns Cigars.\" As Gaz explained in his
    Drinks Bulletin, \"Albert Stevens Crockett might well have been correct when he
    said that the drink could have been named for a cigar salesman, but 'Robert Burns'
    was the name of a brand of cigar, and although it's very possible that the guy
    who owned this shop went by the same name, it's more likely that The Robert Burns
    cocktail that was created at the old Waldorf was named for the shop, as a nod
    to the owner.\" \"The old Waldorf Astoria [which stood on the site of today's
    Empire State Building] didn't open until 1893, some 13 years after the aforementioned
    picture was taken, but it's not a big stretch to think that the cigar vendor was
    still in business when the hotel opened, and the Robert Burns brand of cigars
    was still on the market in the 1960s, or maybe later. Thanks Gaz."

    of Drambuie. However, the Drambuie is preferable because it is made with a Scotch

  comment: The success or failure of this tangy drink is partly reliant on the quality

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Created in the late 1990s by Salvatore Calabrese at the Library Bar, London,
    England. It is very similar to the 'Marmalade Cocktail' created in the 1920s by
    Harry Craddock and published in his 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book' or you could
    describe this as being White Lady with marmalade in it. Salvatore came up with
    the idea for this drink after his wife insisted he have breakfast one morning
    and served up toast and marmalade. He took the jar to work with him and this contemporary
    classic was the result. This drink was the inspiration for the many variations
    on the preserve (jam/marmalade) theme that have followed in the decade since Salvatore
    stopped for 'proper' breakfast rather than just his usual swift espresso.

  comment: A serious, dry, complex cocktail - less bitter than many of its era, but
    still challenging to more tender modern palates.
  aka: 
  variant: 1/ Bloody Bronx - made with the juice of a blood orange. 2/ Golden Bronx
    - with the addition of an egg yolk. 3/ Silver Bronx - with the addition of egg
    white. 4/ Income Tax Cocktail - with two dashes Angostura bitters. Also see the
    Abbey Martini and Satan's Whiskers.
  origin: 'Created in 1906 by Johnny Solon, a bartender at New York''s Waldorf-Astoria
    Hotel (the Empire State Building occupies the site today), and named after the
    newly opened Bronx Zoo. This is reputedly the first cocktail to use fruit juice.
    In his 1935, The Old Waldorf-Astoria book, A.S. Crockett published what he says
    is "Solon''s own story of the Creation - of the Bronx: We had a cocktail in those
    days called the Duplex, which had a pretty fair demand. One day, I was making
    one for a customer when in came Traverson, head waiter of the Empire Room - the
    main dining room in the original Waldorf. A Duplex was composed of equal parts
    of French [dry] and Italian [sweet] Vermouth, shaken up with squeezed orange peel,
    or two dashes of Orange Bitters. Traverson said, "Why don''t you get up a new
    cocktail? I have a customer who says you can''t do it." "Can''t I?" I replied.
    "Well", I finished the Duplex I was making, and a thought came to me. I poured
    into a mixing glass the equivalent of two jiggers of Gordon Gin. Then I filled
    the jigger with orange juice, so that it made one-third of orange and two-thirds
    of gin. Then into the mixture I put a dash of each Italian and French Vermouth,
    shaking the thing up. I didn''t taste it myself, but I poured it into a cocktail

    See what you think of that." Traverson tasted it. Then he swallowed it whole.
    " ''By God!'' he said, you''ve really got something new! That will make a big
    hit. Make me another and I will take it back to that customer in the dining room.
    Bet you''ll sell a lot of them. Have you got plenty of oranges? If you haven''t,
    you had better stock up, because I''m going to sell a lot of those cocktails during
    lunch." The demand for Bronx cocktails started that day. Pretty soon we were using
    a whole case of oranges a day. And then several cases. The name? No, it wasn''t
    really named directly after the borough or the river so-called. I had been at
    the Bronx Zoo a day or so before, and saw, of course, a lot of beasts I had never
    known. Customers used to tell me of the strange animals they saw after a lot of
    mixed drinks. So when Traverson said to me, as he started to take the drink in
    to the customer, "What''ll I tell him is the name of this drink?" I thought of
    those animals, and said: "Oh, you can tell him it is a ''Bronx''."'

  comment: You are probably used to this drink being served with crushed ice but until
    you have tried it with cubed ice you have not really tried a Caipirinha.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Pronounced 'Kie-Pur-Reen-Yah', the name of this traditional Brazilian cocktail
    literally translates as 'little countryside drink'. It is made by muddling green
    lemons known as 'limon subtil', which are native to Brazil (limes are the best
    substitute when these are not available), and mixing with sugar and cachaca. Be
    sure to muddle in a sturdy, non-breakable glass. In Britain and other 'new' cachaca
    markets it is common practice to serve this drink with crushed ice but in Brazil
    it is usually served with cubed ice. Capirinhas and variations on the theme are
    staples in cachacerias, traditional Brazilian bars which specialise in cachaca.

  comment: There is much debate among bartenders as to whether granulated sugar or
    sugar syrup and if brown or white sugar should be used when making this drink.
    Those who favour granulated sugar argue that muddling with the abrasive crystals
    helps extract the oils from the lime's skin. Personally, I hate the crunch of
    sugar as inevitably not all the granulated sugar dissolves. Whether you should
    use brown or white sugar to make your syrup is another question. I prefer mine
    made the way it is in its native Brazil, with white sugar.
  aka: 
  variant: ''
  origin: In its native Brazil it is usual to serve this drink with cubed ice but
    the drink travelled to the UK at a time when the use of crushed ice was fashionable
    and so in this and other 'new' cachaca markets use of crushed ice has become the
    norm.

  origin: First recorded in Jerry Thomas's 1862 book 'How To Mix Drinks', or 'The

    a shaken drink. That would be explosive. Another early reference to Champagne
    cocktails is in Mark Twain's 1869 novel, Innocents Abroad. It is thought the drink
    found popularity after a bartender named John Dougherty won an 1899 New York cocktail
    competition with a similar drink named Business Brace.

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Recipe adapted from A.S. Crockett's 1935, The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book
    which originally calls for 'orange gin' rather than using an orange liqueur. Crockett
    handily says of this drink, &quot;Add a Cock's Comb if desired.&quot; He also
    explains that the drink &quot;Celebrated the local opening of Edmond Rostand's
    Chanticler&quot;. Edmond Rostand was a French poet and dramatist, best-known for
    his play Cyrano de Bergerac. First released in 1910, Chantecler (correct spelling)
    is a story where the characters are based on barnyard animals, and whose eponymous
    protagonist is a rooster who believes that his song makes the sun rise.By all
    accounts the cocktail is rather better than the play. Incidentally, the 'Chantecler'
    is actually a breed of chicken developed in the early 20th century by Brother
    Wilfred Chantelain, a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac in Oka Canada

  comment: Fortified and slightly sweetened wine cooled and lengthened by ice.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Cobblers emerged in the mid 1800s and circa 1880 the bartender Harry Johnson
    said of the Sherry Cobbler "This drink is without doubt the most popular beverage
    in this country, with ladies as well as with gentlemen. It is a very refreshing
    drink for old and young." Cobblers are served with straws in a goblet filled with
    crushed ice and decorated with fruit and a sprig or two of mint. They are based
    on spirits and/or wine sweetened with sugar syrup or sweet liqueur. Classically
    Cobblers contain little or no citrus but modern variations often call for citrus
    and other fruits to be muddled. Personally I believe it's the lack of citrus that
    sets Cobblers apart. The best examples of these use the tannin and acidity in
    the wine to bitter and so balance.Cobblers are also classically built in the glass.
    I prefer to shake mine to properly cool and mix them before straining over fresh
    crushed ice and stirring. I've taken to calling neo-Martinis which use wine in
    place of citrus 'Cobbled Martinis' (see Cobbled Raspberry Martini) although I
    understand that the name actually refers to the ice and not the fruit.Interestingly,
    this drink is often cited for heralding in the paper straw which wasn't patented
    until 1888. Prior to that straws were just that, 'straw', usually rye, or even
    hollow pasta (macaroni or vermicelli).My version of an old classic.

  comment: Some say the John/Tom Collins was originally made with genever. So is this
    the original or an adaption on the Tom Collins. We will probably never know but
    whatever, it tastes great.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: In England, this drink is traditionally credited to John Collins, a bartender
    who worked at Limmer's Hotel, Conduit Street, London. The 'coffee house' of this
    hotel, a true dive bar, was popular with sporting types during the 19th century,
    and famous, according to the 1860s memoirs of a Captain Gronow, for its gin-punch
    as early as 1814.Others say that the Tom Collins originated in New York, and takes
    its name from the Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874, a practical joke which involved
    telling a friend that a man named Tom Collins had been insulting them, and that
    he could be found in a bar some distance away, and took the city by storm. This
    is supported by the fact that the first known written occurrence of a Tom Collins
    cocktail recipe is found in the 1876 edition of Jerry Thomas' 'The Bartender's
    Guide'. An alternative story attributes the drink to a Collins who started work
    at a New York tavern called the Whitehouse in 1873 and started pouring a thirst
    quencher made with gin. Another identifies a different Tom Collins, who worked
    as a bartender in New Jersey and New York area. There are apparently also versions
    of its creation in San Francisco and Australia, and it is not impossible that
    the drink evolved in two or more places independently. There is also debate as
    to whether Old Tom gin, London Dry gin or Dutch genever was the original spirit
    base. Other spirits have since spawned an entire family of Collins' variants as
    follows:Captain Collins (with Canadian whiskey)Colonel Collins (with Bourbon)Jack
    Collins (with vodka)Jock or Sandy Collins (with Scotch whisky)Joe Collins (with
    vodka)John Collins (with London dry gin)Mike Collins (with Irish whiskey)Pedro
    Collins (with light white rum)Pepito Collins (with tequila)Pierre Collins (with
    cognac/brandy)Tom Collins (with old tom gin)Vodka Collins (AKA Joe Collins)

  comment: An authentic Cosmopolitan should be made with citrus vodka and this formula
    also works well if flavoured vodka is substituted. However, I prefer the simplicity
    of this recipe which when quality juice with at least 24% cranberry is used, the
    balance of vodka, citrus, berry fruit and sweetness is perfect.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The Cosmopolitan is one of those drinks that has had various incarnations
    through the ages - some of them, quite probably, independent of one another. And
    during the 1990s, the familiar blend of cranberry, citrus and vodka was one of
    the most popular cocktails in London and New York. Most people agree a Cosmopolitan
    appeared on the West Coast of America at some point during the 1980s, and travelled
    from there to New York and beyond. Cheryl Cook has a claim to have invented the
    drink during the latter half of the 1980s while head bartender at The Strand on
    Washington Avenue, South Beach, Miami. She apparently based her drink on the newly
    available Absolut Citron vodka and added a splash of triple sec, a dash of Rose's
    lime and, in her own words, "just enough cranberry to make it oh so pretty in
    pink". Her version is believed to have travelled by way of San Francisco to Manhattan
    where Toby Cecchini is credited with first using fresh lime juice in place of
    Rose's at his Passerby bar. A likely early ancestor of the Cosmopolitan is the
    Harpoon, a drink promoted by Ocean Spray during the 1960s which consisted of vodka,
    cranberry juice and a squeeze of fresh lime. And a long-forgotten 1934 book of
    gin recipes, 'Pioneers of Mixing Gin at Elite Bars', contains a recipe for a Cosmopolitan
    that is very similar to today's drink, only with lemon in place of lime, gin in
    place of vodka, and raspberry in place of cranberry. Whatever the origin, however,
    it was Sex And The City's Carrie Bradshaw who popularised the drink when she swapped
    Martinis for Cosmos. And New York's Dale DeGroff played a large part in refining
    today's popular recipe.

  comment: Although it is generally agreed that the Cosmopolitan originated on America's
    West Coast sometime during the 1980s, this drink is most closely identified with
    New York City where bar legend, Dale DeGroff, and HBO's 'Sex and the City' perfected
    the drink and made it stylish. This recipe is from Dale's 2002 'The Craft of the
    Cocktail' where he also explains that while he did not invent the Cosmopolitan,
    in his own words, "What I did do was popularize a definitive recipe that became
    widely accepted as the standard."Dale put the drink on his menu at New York's
    Rainbow Room in 1996 and shortly after it was reported that Madonna had enjoyed
    one. As a result Dale received calls from all over the world asking for the recipe,
    which he had perfected by adding a dash of Cointreau and a flamed orange peel
    twist. New York Magazine credited Dale with the drinks invention, other publications
    followed this and he was asked to present it on several television stations. When
    the HBO television series, 'Sex and the City', debuted in 1998, its creators decided
    the cosmopolitan would be the perfect accompaniment to Carrie Bradshaw's fashionista
    Manhattan lifestyle. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and sexpot Samantha where frequently
    shown sipping Cosmos and when the series hit the big screen in 2008, the film
    closed with the girls questioning why they had ever stopped drinking them.

    TFor the garnish, the trick is to find a lemon or a small orange. I favour lemon,
    which fits into a small wineglass tightly enough to act as a watertight extension
    to the glass. Cut off both ends of the fruit and carefully remove the pulp to
    leave a barrel-shaped shell of skin. Place in the top of the glass - wineglasses
    tend to curve in on themselves and this helps retain the fruit. Wet the edge of
    the glass and exposed fruit shell with sugar syrup and dip in caster sugar to
    frost the edge of both peel and glass. Leave for a couple of hours to form hard
    crust.
  rate: 3.5
  garnish: Lemon or orange that fit the rim (see method).
  glass: Wine
  comment: Some cocktail historians, Ted Haigh included, consider the Crusta the forerunner
    of the Sidecar and in turn the Margarita. It's a very logical argument.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The invention of the Crusta is credited to a Joseph Santina at the Jewel
    of the South or a Joseph Santini at the City Exchange in New Orleans sometime
    during the 1840s or 1850s. It first appeared in print as 'The Brandy Crusta' in
    Jerry Thomas' 1862 bartender's guide. Crustas always contain a spirit, lemon juice
    and sugar - sometimes in the form of a liqueur or liqueurs. They are so named
    due to their sugar rim, which should be applied hours before the drink is made
    so that it is dried hard, or indeed crusty, when the drink is served. Crustas
    are also distinguished by being garnished with a band of orange or lemon zest,
    and are drunk from the rim of the fruit, rather than the rim of the glass. As
    David A. Embury writes in his 1948 'The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', "The distinguishing
    feature of the Crusta is that the entire inside of the glass is lined with lemon
    or orange peel. The drink may be served in either a wineglass or an Old-Fashioned
    glass, although it is much harder to make the peel fit in the Old-Fashioned glass."
    Embury goes on to say, "While the 'Brandy Crusta' is the most common form of this
    drink, it is, after all, merely a Sour-type drink served in fancy style. Substitution
    of a different liquor as a base will give a Gin Crusta, a Rum Crusta, an Applejack
    Crusta, A Whisky Crusta, and so on."

  comment: Basically a rum and coke with a squeeze of lime - but Cuba Libre has much
    more of a ring about it. And it is much more of a drink - the squeeze of lime
    adds layers of complexity and balances the sweetness of the cola.
  aka: 
  variant: Cuba Pintada and Cuba Campechana
  origin: 'The Cuba Libre was born out of Cuba''s War of Independence with the Spanish,
    a war in which, like most Cubans, the Bacardi family were involved. In the late
    1890s, Cuba''s anti-colonial fighters were called the Mamb. Emilito Bacardi, eldest
    son of Emilio Bacardi, was one of them. He began his military service as aide
    de camp to Major General Antonio Maceo, Cuba''s ''Bronze Titan'', fighting the
    Spanish from Cuba''s dense forests, or ''manigua''. During the war he was promoted
    to colonel, and became known as ''El Coronel''.The war was scarcely over when,
    in late 1898 Warren Candler (brother of Asa Candler, then owner of Coca-Cola)
    sailed for Cuba, the first of twenty such trips. As a result of Warren''s visits
    to Cuba, there in May 1899 the company hired a sales merchant to sell Coca-Cola
    syrup for use in soda fountains and appointed Jose Parejo, a Havana wine merchant
    as the Cuban distributor for Coca-Cola. By 1900 Coco-Cola was both popular and
    widely available in Cuba so it is not surprising that American solders still garrisoned
    there started ordering Bacardi Cuban Rum and Coke with a squeeze of the ubiquitous
    lime. One solider in particular, Captain Russell of the US Signal Corp, is credited
    with starting this trend when one day in August 1900 he ordered the combination
    in a Havana bar. Naturally his drink sparked interest from the soldiers around
    him and before long the entire bar was drinking it. The Captain proposed a toast,
    ''Por Cuba libre!'' in celebration of a ''free Cuba''. Fortunately for posterity,
    the event is supported by an affidavit from a witness, Fausto Rodriguez. Rodriguez
    was a personal messenger to General Wood, appointed the military governor of Cuba
    after entering Santiago de Cuba on 17th July 1898, after Roosevelt''s victory
    at the battle of San Juan Hill. After the Republic of Cuba was born on 20th May
    1902, General Wood left Cuba and Fausto Rodriguez returned to Santiago de Cuba.
    Sixty-five years later, on 21st December 1964, Rodriguez told Emilito Bacardi
    the following story, affirmed under oath: "During the period of military intervention,
    two Americans opened and operated a bar called The American Bar on Neptuno Street,
    between Consulado and Prado in Havana. It was patronized almost exclusively by
    American soldiers and by American civilians who worked in the various government
    offices in Havana. "While I was employed at the office of the Signal Corps, I
    became quite friendly with an American whose last name was Russell (I do not remember
    his given name). He worked in the office of the Chief Signal Officer. Mr Russell
    frequently took me to The American Bar where we used to drink Bacardi Rum and
    Coca-Cola. "One afternoon in August 1900, I went to The American Bar with Mr Russell,
    and he drank his usual Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola. I just drank Coca-Cola, being
    only 14 years old. On that occasion, there was a group of American soldiers at
    the bar, and one of them asked Mr Russell what he was drinking. He told them it
    was Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola and suggested they try it, which they did. "The
    soldiers who drank the Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola said they liked it, and wanted
    to know what the drink was called. When Mr Russell told them that the drink did
    not have a name, one of the soldiers said, "Let''s give it a name". Another said,
    "How about calling it ''Cuba Libre''?" They all agreed and ordered another round
    of Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola, calling it a Cuba Libre. To my best knowledge, this
    is the first time this phrase ''Cuba Libre'' has been applied to a drink. Thus,
    the first Cuba Libre consisted of Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola."During the American
    intervention, the words Cuba Libre - meaning Free Cuba - had a special political
    significance, and were used a great deal by the Cubans and Americans in Cuba.
    It seemed quite natural that the American soldiers selected and applied this popular
    slogan to this drink, which they considered indigenous to Cuba, consisting of
    Bacardi Rum and Coca-Cola. The name caught on quickly, and has remained popular
    to the present time." (sic) The Cuba Libre peaked in popularity during the 1940s,
    partly aided by the Andrews Sisters who in 1945 had a hit with ''Rum and Coca-Cola'',
    named after the drink''s ingredients. During the war, all spirits production went
    over to industrial alcohol - in the absence of whiskey and gin, Americans turned
    to imported rum. The Cuba Libre is an enduring classic, still made with Bacardi
    rum and still enjoyed the world.'

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'Pronounced ''Dye-Ker-Ree'', this drink bears a close relationship to the
    Canchanchara, a 19th century Cuban blend of rum, lemon, honey and water, but the
    Daiquiris creation is credited Jennings Stockton Cox, an American engineer. In
    1898, after Roosevelt''s victory at the Battle of San Juan Hill, the Americans
    began to exploit Cuba''s iron-ore mines and Cox led one of the initial exploratory
    expeditions. Cox and his team worked in the Sierra Maestra Mountains on the south-eastern
    shore of Cuba where the small town of Daiquir lies and it was while there that
    he created his classic drink. The engineers received substantial salaries and
    generous tobacco rations, after all there had to be some inducements for these
    qualified engineers to leave secure positions in the USA and brave the threat
    of yellow fever in Cuba. Thankfully our hero also requested they each received
    a monthly ration of the local rum, Bacardi Carta Blanca, and noticing that the
    Cuban workers often mixed Bacardi with their evening coffee, he began to experiment
    himself. Drinks legend has it that another engineer called Pagliuchi was viewing
    mines in the region and met with Cox. During their meeting they set about making
    a drink from the ingredients Cox had to hand: rum, limes and sugar. Cox''s granddaughter
    recounts a slightly different tale; namely that Cox ran out of gin when entertaining
    American guests. Wary of serving them straight rum, he added lime and sugar. However
    Cox came to concoct the drink, the result was sublime. On page 38 of his 1928
    book, ''When it''s Cocktail Time in Cuba'', Basil Woon writes that this drink
    was popular with a group who used to meet in Santiago''s Venus bar every morning
    at eight o''clock. "The boys used to have three or four every morning. Most of
    them worked in the Daiquiri mines, the superintendent of which was a gentleman
    named Cox - Jennings Cox. One morning in the Venus Cox said: "Boys, we''ve been
    drinking this delicious little drink for some time, but we''ve never named it.
    Let''s christen it now!" The boys milled around a bit and finally Cox said: "I''ll
    tell you what, lads - we all work at Daiquiri and we all drank this drink first
    there. Let''s call it a Daiquiri." Basil Woon''s account documents the origin
    and naming of the Daiquiri and unlike many other cocktails where there creation
    is lost in time, that of the Daiquiri is well substantiated, including the original
    recipe, recorded by Jennings Cox in his personal diary. The Daiquiri seems to
    have travelled back to America with US Admiral Lucius Johnson, who fought in the
    Spanish-American war of 1898. He introduced the drink to the Army &amp; Navy Club
    in Washington DC and a plaque in their Daiquiri Lounge records his place in cocktail
    history.The Perfect Daiquiri RecipeIn his seminal 1948 ''Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'',
    David A. Embury writes, "The Daiquiri, like the Old-Fashioned, deserves an even
    greater popularity than it now enjoys. For example, it is in my opinion, a vastly
    superior cocktail to the Manhattan, yet most bars sell more Manhattans than Daiquiris.
    So far as I can ascertain there are two main reasons why more Daiquiris are not
    sold: the use of inferior rums and the use of improper proportions." To address
    those two points... In his personal diary Jennings Cox records his original Daiquiri
    recipe (to serve six) as follows:The juice of six lemonsSix teaspoons full of
    sugar Six Bacardi cups (''carta blanca'')Two small cups of mineral waterPlenty
    of crushed ice This original recipe and other such historical references specify
    ''Bacardi Carta Blanca'' (now known as Bacardi Superior) as the rum used to make
    a Daiquiri. Thus to make a truly authentic Daiquir you should use this rum as
    it is still made using the same strain of cultured yeast and recipe so maintains
    its original flavour profile. Bacardi Superior has a delicate blue cheese note,
    which adds a distinctive character to the finished drink. Although Cox''s recipe
    records the use of lemons it is most likely that he is actually referring to limes
    which are native to Cuba and that the confusion arises due to the common Cuban
    term for lime being ''limn''. Again to quote from Embury, "Actually lemons are
    almost unknown in Cuba, whereas lime trees grow in everyone''s own yard." Embury''s
    own recipe calls for sugar syrup and this is something with which I whole-heartedly
    agree as granulated or caster sugar does not as readily dissolve in cold liquid.
    If you must insist in ''spooning'' your sugar please use a mortar and pestle to
    first crush caster sugar to a fine powder, often termed ''bar sugar'' or ''powdered
    sugar''. Better still, make your own sugar syrup by pouring one mug of filtered
    water into a saucepan and over a very low heat, so as not to even come close to
    boiling, stir in two mugs of caster sugar. Allow to cool, bottle and store in
    a refrigerator where it will last for a couple of months. Thus we have our ingredients:
    Bacardi Superior, freshly squeezed lime juice and 2-to-1 (double strength) sugar
    syrup. Now to the perfect proportions. London''s most famous bartender, Dick Bradsell,
    originally taught me Embury''s 8:2:1 Daiquiri formula and I used to believe this
    was the best (I still do when making Daiquiris with aged rum. David Embury''s
    8:2:1 Daiquiri consists: 8 parts (2 shots) white label Cuban rum, 2 parts (1/2
    shot) lime juice and 1 part (1/4 shot) sugar syrup. Some bartenders make Daiquiris
    according to the classic Margarita formula with twice as much lime. I have experimented
    with this but found that while tequila is robust enough to shine above the citrus
    flavour it tends to overpower the more delicate flavours of light rum. However,
    I do prefer a small increase in lime but also found a small increase in the rum
    beneficial. After all a mere two measures of rum would hardly satisfy great Daiquiri
    drinkers such as Hemingway. Thus I have now settled on the 10:3:2 formula above.
    Embury''s mixing instructions are, "Shake vigorously with plenty of finely crushed
    ice and strain into chilled cocktail glasses." This is to add dilution, a crucial
    aspect to perfecting the Daiquiri. As crushed ice is so variable in its wetness
    and so also the amount of dilution it adds to a drink, instead I prefer to shake
    with large cubes of double frozen ice taken from a freezer with the addition of
    1/2 shot iced water. (I ''double freeze'' cubed ice produced by ice machine).
    I shake with such vigour that there is indeed crushed ice left in the shaker when
    I strain the drink. This makes for an ice-cold Daiquiri with the controlled dilution
    essential to great straight-up Daiquiris. What''s in the NameI first visited Cuba
    with Jamie Terrell back in the days when he was still working behind the stick
    at London''s Atlantic Bar &amp; Grill and not living a cachaca laced jet-set lifestyle
    in New York. Fortunately Jamie spoke reasonable Spanish thanks to a sun-drenched
    season bartending on the Costa del Sol so as we toured Havana''s bars in search
    of the perfect Daiquiri we were able to question the bartenders. Our first lesson
    was that asking for a mere ''Daiquiri'' would result in being handed a blended
    Daiquiri. We quickly learnt that in Cuba you need to ask for a ''Natural Daiquiri''
    if you seek your Daiquiri shaken rather than blended. Wherever you are in the
    world, when ordering a Daiquiri you need to convey to the bartender exactly what
    Daiquiri you desire. It is essential to be specific otherwise ordering just a
    ''Daiquiri'' could result in your being asked, "What flavour would you like -
    strawberry, banana, mango or pineapple?" In such cases answering "just lime please"
    often leaves the questioner perplexed. To further confuse the ordering of a Daiquiri,
    the great Ribalagua listed his Daiquiri adaptations as Daiquiri No.2, No.3, No.4
    and No.5. Thus a simple ''original'' or ''classic'' Daiquiri should properly be
    termed ''Daiquiri No.1'' and this can be served either ''Natural'' (straight-up),
    ''On-The-Rocks'' or ''Frozen''.'

  aka: 
  variant: Floridita Daiquiri or with fruit and/or fruit liqueurs.
  origin: Daiquiris were originally shaken and served 'straight-up' or 'on-the-rocks'.
    The frozen, blended version is said to have first been produced by Emilio Gonzalez
    at the Plaza Hotel in Cuba. However, it was made famous by Constantino (Constante)
    Ribalagua Vert who presided over the bar at Havana's La Florida (later renamed
    Floridita to distinguish it from the restaurant of the same name) for some forty
    years until his death in early December 1952. In his 1948 'The Fine Art of Mixing
    Drinks', David A. Embury writes of Havana's Floridita, "This restaurant, at the
    corner of Obispo and Monserrate streets in Havana, became known as 'La Catedral
    del Daiquiri' - The Temple of the Daiquiri - and Ribalagua as the Cocktail King
    - 'El Rey de los Coteleros'. The title was, indeed, well deserved. His limes were
    gently squeezed with his fingers lest even a drop of the bitter oil from the peel
    get into the drink; the cocktails were mixed (but not overmixed) in a Waring Blender;
    the stinging cold drink was strained through a fine sieve into the glass so that
    not one tiny piece of the ice remained in it. No smallest detail was overlooked
    in achieving the flawless perfection of the drink." Ernest Hemingway, the hard-drinking,
    Nobel prize-winning author, lived in Cuba for years, indulging his passions for
    fishing, shooting and boozing. In the 30s and the 40s he would often work his
    way through twelve of the Floridita's frozen Daiquiris - often doubles, renamed
    'Papa Dobles' in his honour. The Hemingway Special Daiquiri, which includes grapefruit,
    was created for him. In his book 'Islands in the Stream', Hemingway's hero stares
    deep into his frozen Daiquiri, and Hemingway writes, "It reminded him of the sea.
    The frappd part of the drink was like the wake of a ship and the clear part was
    the way the water looked when the bow cut it when you were in shallow water over
    marl bottom. That was almost the exact colour."

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: In my formative Daiquiri drinking years I followed the convention that a
    Daiquiri No.1 should be served 'straight-up'. However, I have now reverted to
    drinking my Daiquiris 'on-the-rocks' and interestingly Cox's original recipe (see
    Daiquiri No.1 Natural) suggests that this may also be the way he originally intended
    the drink to be served. In his diary Cox stipulates, "Put all ingredients in a
    cocktail shaker and shake well. Do not strain as the glass may be served with
    some ice." And as Albert S. Crockett notes of this drink in his 1935 'The Old
    Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book', "Personal preference dictates serving the cocktail
    with finely shaved ice in the glass." Obviously serving a drink over ice will
    add dilution so rendering the additional dash of water to my 10:3:2 Daiquiri formula
    superfluous. Having tried 'up' and 'on-the-rocks' Daiquiris made to the same 'No.1'
    formula next to each other I have to admit that more nuances are found in the
    'up' when compared to 'on-the-rocks'. However, I prefer holding and drinking from
    a big heavy old-fashioned glass rather than a V-shaped Martini or curvaceous Coupette.
    Thus I now vary my serve according to mood but with 1/2 shot of water added when
    served 'up' and omitted when served 'on-the-rocks'.

  comment: Remembering that Hemingway was a diabetic so has a very sour tooth, I believe
    this drink needs more than "one teaspoon" of sugar. Thus I have added half a shot
    of syrup to the original recipe. It also needs dilution, so be sure to shake well
    and churn in the glass.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: According to 'Gentleman's Companion' this libation was a favourite of Ernest
    Hemingway. "... we got Hemingway's other picker-upper, and liked it. Take a tall
    thin water tumbler and fill it with finely cracked ice. Lace this broken debris
    with four good purple splashes of Angostura, add the juice and crushed peel of
    one green lime, and fill the glass almost full with Holland gin . . . No sugar,
    no fancying. It's strong, it's bitter - but so is English ale strong and bitter,
    in many cases. We don't add sugar to ale, and we don't need sugar in a Death In
    The Gulf Stream - or at least not more than one teaspoon. Its tartness and its
    bitterness are its chief charm. It is reviving and refreshing; cools the blood
    and inspires renewed interest in food, companions and life."

  origin: Discovered in 1999 at One Aldwych, London, England. This cocktail takes
    its name from Oscar Wilde's novel, in which a socialite's wish to remain as young
    and charming as his own portrait is granted. Allured by his depraved friend Lord
    Henry Wotton, Dorian Gray assumes a life of perversion and sin. But every time
    he sins the painting ages, while Gray stays young and healthy.

    Many modern variations use soda water (club soda) in place of mineral water. The
    inclusion of peach liqueur is a modern substitute for the traditional peach brandy.
    However, it's believed the Schuylkill original omitted peach entirely.

  comment: I recommend the Derby Fizz with its combination of liqueur and spirits
    over these more traditional versions.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'Like the Collins, this mid-19th century classic is basically a sour lengthened
    with charged water and at first glance there is little difference between a Fizz
    and a Collins. However, there are several distinguishing features. A Collins should
    be served in at least a twelve ounce, and ideally a fourteen ounce tall glass,
    while that used for a Fizz should be no bigger than eight ounces. A Collins should
    be served in an ice-filled glass, while a Fizz should be served in a chilled glass
    without ice. A Fizz should also be made using charged water from a siphon in preference
    to soda from bottles or cans. The burst of pressure from the siphon bulb generates
    tiny bubbles which give off carbonic acid, benefiting the flavour and the mouth-feel
    of the drink. For the correct proportions I have turned to David A. Embury''s
    seminal ''The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks''. He recommends "1 - or a little less
    - sweet (sugar, fruit syrup, or liqueur), 2 sour (lime or lemon juice), 3 - or
    a little more - strong (spirituous liquor), and 4 weak (charged water and ice).
    I interpret this as follows: 2 shots spirit (gin, whiskey, vodka, brandy), 1 shot

  origin: Created at Chasen's, a legendary Hollywood restaurant that opened in 1936
    and was a haunt of movie stars and even royalty until its eventual demise in 1995.
    The memorabilia that decorated the restaurant was held in storage and in 1997
    Maud and Dave Chasen's grandson opened another Chasen's on Beverly Hills' Ca~non
    Drive which sadly failed due to a lack of patrons. During the original Chasen's
    heyday its star-studded clientele enjoyed drinks created by its noted bartender
    Pepe Ruiz. Of these the Flame of Love is his most famous creation, partly due
    to its originally being made for Dean Martin. The legend of this drink is further
    embellished by Dean dragging his old pal Frank Sinatra to Chasen's to try the
    drink. The story goes that Frank was so impressed that he ordered one for everyone
    in the place.

  origin: Flips basically consist of any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole
    egg and sweetened with sugar. They can also contain cream and are typically garnished
    with a dusting of nutmeg and served in a sour glass or small Martini glass. They
    can be served hot or cold. The very first Flips, which emerged as early as the
    late 1600s, consisted of tankard of ale to which a mixture made from sugar, eggs
    and spices was added before being heated with a red-hot iron poker from the fire.
    Later they came to mean any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole egg and
    sweetened with sugar.

  comment: Fresh, clean, sophisticated - very drinkable and hasn't dated.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Legend has it that the drink was created by Harry MacElhone at his Harry's
    American Bar, Paris, in 1925 and was named after the 75mm Howitzer field gun used
    by the French army during the First World War (1914 to 1918). However, like other
    drinks in the first (1919) edition of Harry's own book, 'The ABC of Mixing Drinks',
    he credits the drink to Macgarry of Buck's Club, London, England.However, its
    creation is now commonly attributed to the USA during the Prohibition era (1920-1933).
    Although the Howitzer was mounted on American tanks my issues with the American
    origin theory are that the Great War was well over by the time Prohibition started
    and I question whether an American, now or then, would name a drink after a metric
    measurement. Being a Brit, I favour The French 75 being an English drink that
    gained in popularity in France during the Prohibition era and found its way to
    the US with returning officers.

  comment: A classic Dry Martini with cocktail onions in place of an olive or a twist.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Today a Gibson is a Dry Martini served with two onions. Charles Dana Gibson
    produced hugely popular pen-and-ink drawings between the 1890s and 1930s. His
    illustrations of girls were as iconic as modern-day supermodels, and it is said
    this drink was named after the well-endowed Gibson Girls - hence the two onions.
    However, a cocktail book published in 1917 includes a Martini-like drink named
    Gibson but without the onions, and a separate Onion cocktail which we might today
    call a Gibson. Gibson was a member of New York's The Players' club and a bartender
    there by the name of Charley Connolly is credited for at least adding the garnish,
    if not actually creating the drink.

  comment: A simple blend of gin and sweet lime.
  aka: 
  variant: Other spirits, particularly vodka, may be substituted for gin.
  origin: 'In 1747, James Lind, a Scottish surgeon, discovered that consumption of
    citrus fruits helped prevent scurvy, one of the most common illnesses on board
    ship. (We now understand that scurvy is caused by a Vitamin C deficiency and that
    it is the vitamins in citrus fruit which help ward off the condition.) In 1867,
    the Merchant Shipping Act made it mandatory for all British ships to carry rations
    of lime juice for the crew. Lauchlin Rose, the owner of a shipyard in Leith, Scotland,
    had been working to solve the problem of how to keep citrus juice fresh for months
    on board ship. In 1867 he patented a process for preserving fruit juice without
    alcohol. To give his product wider appeal he sweetened the mixture, packaged it
    in an attractive bottle and named it ''Rose''s Lime Cordial''.Once the benefits
    of drinking lime juice became more broadly known, British sailors consumed so
    much of the stuff, often mixed with their daily ration of rum and water (''grog''),
    that they became affectionately known as ''Limeys''. Naval officers mixed Rose''s
    lime cordial with gin to make Gimlets. A ''gimlet'' was originally the name of
    a small tool used to tap the barrels of spirits which were carried on British
    Navy ships: this could be the origin of the drink''s name. Another story cites
    a naval doctor, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette (1857-1943), who is said
    to have mixed gin with lime ''to help the medicine go down''. Although this is
    a credible story it is not substantiated in his obituary in The Times, 6 October
    1943.'

  comment: This might not be considered a cocktail by most, but it is actually classified
    as a Highball. Whatever, it's one of the simplest and best drinks ever devised,
    hence its lasting popularity.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The precise origin of the G&amp;T is lost in the mists of time. Gin (or
    at least a grain based juniper spirit) was drunk for medicinal reasons from the
    1600s onwards. Quinine, the pungent bark extract which gives tonic its distinctive
    bitterness, had been used against malaria for even longer. The first known quinine-based
    tonics were marketed during the 1850's. The popularity of tonic in the British
    colonies, especially India, is clear. Schweppes launched their first carbonated
    quinine tonic in 1870, branding it Indian Tonic Water. The ladies and gentlemen
    of the Raj also drank phenomenal quantities of gin. It is therefore accepted that
    gin and tonic emerged in India during the second half of the nineteenth century
    and was drunk partly to ward off malaria.

    most famed: a Captain Gronow recalled it in his 1860s memoirs as one of the top,
    if filthy and seedy, sporting hangouts of 1814, thanks in part to its ''famous
    gin-punch''. A bartender named John Collins worked there later in the 19th century,
    and was famous enough to inspire a limerick, so many believe he created the Collins,
    which is similar to gin punch, although the drink is not named in the rhyme which
    goes as follows:My name is John Collins, head waiter at Limmer''s,Corner of Conduit
    Street, Hanover Square,My chief occupation is filling brimmersFor all the young
    gentlemen frequenters there.'

    ice, most delicious! We are the largest consumer of Galliano in the world. Also
    famous for our award winning barbequed ribs.The above shaken recipe also includes

  comment: Strong, flavoursome Navy rum with a splash of scurvy-inhibiting lime. Too

  aka: 
  variant: Hot Grog
  origin: For over 300 years the British Navy issued a daily 'tot' of rum, sometimes
    with double issues before battle. In 1740, as an attempt to combat drunkenness,
    Admiral Vernon gave orders that the standard daily issue of half a pint of neat,
    high-proof rum be replaced with two servings of a quarter of a pint, diluted 4:1
    with water. The Admiral was nicknamed 'Old Grogram' due to the waterproof grogram
    cloak he wore, so the mixture he introduced became known as 'grog'. Lime juice
    was often added to the grog in an attempt to prevent scurvy, lending British sailors
    their 'limey' nickname. The 'tot' tradition, which started in Jamaica in 1665,
    was finally broken on 31st July 1970, a day now known as 'Black Tot Day' - although
    by then the 'tot' had been reduced to a meagre two ounces. Sounds plausible to
    me but drinks historians now say that grog is earlier than Old Grogram.

  origin: Created in the early 1900s by Ada 'Coley' Coleman at The Savoy's American
    Bar, London, for actor Sir Charles Hawtrey. He often said to Coley, "I am tired.
    Give me something with a bit of punch in it." This drink was her answer. After
    finishing his first one, Charles told Coley, "By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!"
    And so it has since been named. Coley was the first Bar Manger of the famous American
    Bar. She perfected her craft at Claridge's and left to start at the Savoy in July
    1903, where she stayed until her retirement in December 1924. The Hanky-Panky
    is her most famous creation.

  comment: Like the Screwdriver, the HArvey Wallbanger has sadly waned in popularity
    in recent years, probably due to it being served with packaged orange juice. When
    made with freshly squeezed orange juice and recently revived Galliano L'Autentico
    this is worthy of a renaissance.
  aka: 
  variant: Freddie Fudpucker
  origin: Legend has it that 'Harvey' was a surfer at Manhattan beach, California.
    His favourite drink was a Screwdriver with added Galliano. One day in the late
    sixties, while celebrating winning a surfing competition, he staggered from bar
    to bar, banging his surfboard on the walls, and so a contemporary classic gained
    its name. However, an article in Bartender Magazine credits the creation to Bill
    Donner, the host of a house party held in the mid-sixties in Newport Beach, California.
    One of the guests, Harvey, was found banging his head the next morning, complaining
    of the hangover this drink induced.

  comment: A true Hemingway Special should be served without the addition of sugar.
    However, Hemingway had a hardened palate and more delicate drinkers may prefer
    the recipe above.
  aka: Papa Doble Daiquiri
  variant: 
  origin: Created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert, the legendary head bartender
    of La Floridita, Havana, Cuba for Ernest Hemingway, after the great man wandered
    into the bar to use the toilet. When Hemingway tried the Floridita's standard
    frozen Daiquiri, he is quoted as saying, "That's good but I prefer it without
    sugar and with double rum," so the Hemingway Special was born. Hemingway suffered
    from haemochromotosis, a rare and hereditary form of diabetes from which his father
    also suffered, hence his aversion to sugar. The original version was exactly as
    Hemingway requested a Daiquiri without sugar and heavy on the rum, basically rum
    shaken with a splash of lime juice. Years later after he took over the position
    of Head Bartender at La Floridita, Antonio Meilan added maraschino and grapefruit
    juice into the drink. Today sugar is commonly also added to balance this drink
    and make it more palatable to people with less sour palates than Hemingway. Hemingway
    was affectionately known as 'Papa' in Cuba and this drink was originally named
    'Daiquiri Like Papa' and then later 'Papa Doble'. After Meilan added maraschino
    and grapefruit the drink changed its name again to the Hemingway Special we recognise
    today.

    kinda evilly 'Hampton-ish' about this drink... but I also called it 'He's At Home'
    which was the name given to porcelain dildos that Nantucket ship's captain's wives
    kept stashed in the flue of their fireplaces for the lonely winter nights when
    the old dog was chasing whales."

  glass: Collins
  comment: Simple, but simplicity can be beautiful.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Scotch &amp; Soda, Gin &amp; Tonic, Whiskey &amp; Ginger, Vodka &amp; Tonic
    and Rum &amp; Coke are all examples of Highball cocktails. Highballs are a type
    of simple cocktail with only two ingredients, normally a spirit and a carbonate,
    served in a tall ice-filled glass (often referred to as a highball glass). Unlike
    Rickeys, Collinses and Fizzes, Highballs do not contain citrus fruit juice. In
    his 1934 'The Official Mixer's Guide', Patrick Gavin Duffy writes, &quot;It is
    one of my fondest hopes that the highball will again take its place as the leading
    American Drink. I admit to being prejudiced about this - it was I who first brought
    the highball to America, in 1895. Although the distinction is claimed by the Parker
    House in Boston, I was finally given due credit for this innovation in the New
    York Times of not many years ago.&quot; That New York Times reference appears
    to be a letter written by Duffy on 22 October 1927 to the Editor in response to
    an editorial piece in the paper. He starts, "An editorial in The Times says that
    the Adams House, Boston, claims to have served the first Scotch highball in this
    country. This claim is unfounded." He goes on to tell of how in 1894 he opened
    a little cafe next the old Lyceum in New York City and that in the Spring of that
    year, an English actor and regular patron, E. J. Ratcliffe, one day asked for
    a Scotch and soda. At that time Duffy did not carry Scotch but this request and
    the growing number of English actors frequenting his bar led Duffy to order five
    cases of Usher's from Park &amp; Tilford. Duffy claims that when the shipment
    arrived he "sold little but Scotch highballs", consisting of "Scotch, a lump of
    ice and a bottle of club soda". His letter finishes, &quot;Shortly afterward every
    actor along Broadway, and consequently every New Yorker who frequented the popular
    bars, was drinking Scotch highballs. In a few years other Scotch distillers introduced
    their brands and many were enriched by the quantity consumed in this country.
    Actors on tour, and members of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery of Boston,
    who came here annually to attend the Old Guard Ball, brought the new drink to
    the Adams House." Duffy's letter to The New York Times mentions Adam House in
    Boston while the reference in his subsequent book talks of "Parker House". Both
    are plausible Boston locations but does this confusion mean we should not take
    any of Duffy's claims for being the first to make Scotch Highballs in America
    seriously? The Times merely published Duffy's letter to the editor, the paper
    did not substantiate or even "give credit" to his claims. In his 2003 'The Joy
    of Mixology', Gary Regan explains that "Highball is an old railroad term for the
    ball indicator connected to a float inside a steam train's water tank which told
    the conductor that there was enough water in the tank and so the train could proceed.
    Apparently when the train was set to depart, the conductor would give the highball
    - two short whistle blows and one long. Gary explains that this term was apt as
    the drinks consist of 2 shots of liquor and a long pour of mixer.

  origin: Created in December 2009 by Alan Brown of Menzel's Bar, who says of this
    drink "Over the busy festive period, feeling full of flu and cold I decided to
    make a hot toddy to soothe my symptoms. Having no honey to hand I tried using
    agave nectar instead. This led me to the idea of using tequila and lime instead
    of lemon (to complement the tequila) with the agave and boiling water. The name
    for the drink is a Hot Tommy, a nod to the Tommy's Margarita, which makes use
    of both tequila and agave."

  comment: Like most great ideas, this one is very simple. Coffee with a whiskey kick.
  aka: Gaelic Coffee
  variant: Sweeten with sugar syrup or liqueur to taste before floating cream.
  origin: This now ubiquitous cocktail was created in 1942 by Joe Sheridan, a bartender
    at Foynes airport (near the present-day Shannon airport). The majority of transatlantic
    flights used to stop to refuel in Ireland and in 1947 an American journalist,
    Stan Delaphane, found himself at Joe Sheridan's bar and tried his Irish Coffee.
    Delaphane was so impressed that on returning home he passed the recipe on to the
    bartender at his local bar, the Buena Vista Caf in San Francisco. The recipe spread
    and the drink became a classic.

  aka:

  origin: The Irish tricolour is the national flag of the Republic of Ireland. Its
    three equal stripes represent the political landscape. Orange stands for the Protestants
    because of William of Orange, the Protestant king of England who defeated the
    Roam Catholic James II in 1690. Green stands for the Catholic nationalists of
    the south and white for the the hope of peace between Catholics and Protestants.

  origin: Like many great classics this drink is served with numerous plausible origins:1.
    The Jack Rose is named after the Jacqueminot rose, which in turn takes its name
    from the French general, Jean-Francois Jacqueminot. According to Albert S. Crockett's
    1935 'The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book', it is "So called because of its pink
    colour, the exact shade of a Jacqueminot rose, when properly concocted."2. Some
    credit this drink's creation to the Colt's Neck inn in New Jersey, which was originally
    owned by a member of the Laird's family of applejack distillers. His name was
    Jack and 'Rose' is said to be a reference to the drink's reddish-pink hue. However,
    this theory has been discredited by Lisa Laird-Dunn, a ninth generation Laird
    family ancestor.3. Other simply claim 'Jack' is short for 'applejack' and again
    hold that 'Rose' a reference to the drink's colour.4. According to the Police
    Gazette of 1905, Frank J. May, better known as Jack Rose, a wrestling bartender
    who held bar at Gene Sullivan's Cafe, 187 Pavonia Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey
    created this drink.5. However, the most popular theory relates to a late 19th
    century New York small-time gangster called Jack Rose who was the informant in
    a notorious 1912 murder case. 'Bald' Jack Rose, whose favourite beverage is said
    to have been applejack brandy with lemon and grenadine, was heavily implicated
    in the 1912 the shooting of Herman Rosenthal, the owner of several New York gambling
    dens who was in throws of blowing the lid on police and municipal links to organised
    crime. Rosenthal had already squealed to the press and on the evening of July
    15, after the lengthily delivery of his affidavit, left D.A. Charles Whitman's
    office at around midnight. Fatally he then headed to the Metropole Caf at the
    Hotel Metropole on West 43rd Street, a favourite late night gambler's haunt, for
    a nightcap. As he exited the Metropole he was killed by four bullets, one to the
    chest and three to his head. The hit was pinned on a Lieutenant Charles Becker
    of the NYPD's antigambling squad and Rose was star witness in what was then the
    trial of the century. Becker went to the electric chair while Rose apparently
    went into the catering business, lending his name to his favourite drink.6. Or,
    alternatively, it could be named after 'Jack Rose', an early 20th century brand
    of small cigars which sold for five cents a pack. Interestingly, these little
    cigars became known by the nickname 'squealers' after the Rosenthal case.

  comment: A refreshing balance of sour lemon and sugar, laced with gin and lengthened

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: In England, this drink is traditionally credited to John Collins, a bartender
    who worked at Limmer's Hotel, Conduit Street, London. The 'coffee house' of this
    hotel, a true dive bar, was popular with sporting types during the 19th century,
    and famous, according to the 1860s memoirs of a Captain Gronow, for its gin-punch
    as early as 1814. John (or possibly Jim) Collins, head waiter of Limmer's, is
    immortalised in a limerick, which was apparently first printed in an 1892 book
    entitled 'Drinks of the World'. In 1891 a Sir Morell Mackenzie had identified
    John Collins as the creator of the Tom Collins, using this limerick, although
    both the words of the rhyme and the conclusions he drew from it were disputed.
    But, according to this version of the story, the special gin-punch for which John
    Collins of Limmer's was famous went on to become known as the Tom Collins when
    it was made using Old Tom gin. The original Collins was probably based on genever
    gin, but there is also debate as to whether it was Old Tom or London Dry. To further
    complicate the issue a 'John Collins' appears to be exactly the same drink as
    a 'Tom Collins'. Thus I make a 'Collins' with genever gin, a 'Tom Collins' with
    old tom gin, and a 'John Collins' with London dry gin. Confused? Then you should
    also check out the 'Gin Punch' (which has the addition of bitters) and a 'Gin
    Fizz' which is topped with soda from a siphon.

    hours.) Add other ingredients to shaker, SHAKE with ice and strain into glass
    filled with crushed ice. CHURN (stir) the drink with the crushed ice using a bar
    spoon. Top with more crushed ice to fill glass and churn again. Serve with straws.

  garnish: Mint sprig
  glass: Collins
  comment: The key to this drink is serving it ice cold and giving the flavours in
    themint time to marry with the spirit. Hence, Juleps are ideally prepared hours
    in advance of serving. Adjust sugar to balance if using a fortified wine in place
    of a spirit.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Juleps are tall drinks generally served in Collins glasses but originally
    served in julep cups and based on a spirit, liqueur or fortified wine. They are
    most often served with fresh mint over crushed ice. The name ultimately derives
    from the Arabic word 'julab', meaning rosewater. Although this had been used to
    describe any sweetened drink, up to and including medicines. The Julep is thought
    to have originated in Persia, or there abouts, and it travelled to Europe (some
    say Southern France) where the rose petals were substituted for indigenous mint.
    The drink is then believed to have crossed the Atlantic where cognac was replaced
    with peach brandy and then whiskey - the Mint Julep we recognise today. The first
    known written reference to a cocktail-style Julep was by a Virginian gentleman
    in 1787.

    George died when a salesman accidentally dropped a tray of sweets, they fell in
    a muddle and the famous sweet was born.

  origin: The Mismo was a craze said to be started by a group of Americans at the
    Cosmopolitan Club in Santiago in 1899. When ordering drinks, one of their Cuban
    colleagues asked for a Bacardi rum and seltzer (soda). His friend, also Cuban,
    called for 'Lo mismo' - Spanish for 'the same'. Not speaking Spanish, but eager
    to fit in, the Americans all also asked for 'lo mismos'. The next day, the Americans
    returned and ordered another round of 'Mismos' from the same barman. The name
    stuck. 'It spread with remarkable rapidity', reported the New York Tribune soon
    after. 'Now every barkeeper in Santiago knows what you are after if you ask for
    a "Mismo".

  comment: I love Daiquiris and this is basically a classic Daiquiri with a few bells

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: In 1934, Victor Jules Bergeron, or Trader Vic as he became known, opened
    his first restaurant in Oakland, San Francisco. He served Polynesian food with
    a mix of Chinese, French and American dishes cooked in wood-fired ovens. But he
    is best known for the rum based cocktails he created. One evening in 1944 he tested
    a new drink on two friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild. After the first
    sip, Carrie exclaimed, &quot;Mai Tai-Roa A&quot;, which in Tahitian means 'Out
    of this world - the best!'. So Bergeron named his drink the Mai Tai. The original
    was based on 17 year old Jamaican J.Wray &amp; Nephew rum which Vic in his own
    guide describes as being "surprisingly golden in colour, medium bodied, but with
    the rich pungent flavour particular to the Jamaican blends". Vic states he used
    "rock candy" syrup, an old term for the type of strong sugar syrup I prescribe
    in this guide. The term referred to the fact that you could dangle a piece of
    string in it to encourage crystallisation and make rock candy. When supplies of
    the Jamaican 17-year-old rum dwindled, Vic started using a combination of dark
    Jamaican rum and Martinique rum to achieve the desired flavour. Sheer demand in
    his chain of restaurants later necessitated the introduction of a Mai Tai pre-mix
    (still available from www.tradervics.com). Others, particularly Ernest Raymond
    Beaumont-Gantt, then owner of a Hollywood bar called Don the Beachcomber's, have
    also laid claim to the creation of this drink. But as Vic says in his own Bartender's
    Guide, "Anybody who says I didn't create this drink is a dirty stinker." This
    recipe is adapted from Victor Bergeron's 'Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide' (1972
    revised edition).

  origin: Like so many cocktails, the origins of the Manhattan are lost in time. And,
    as neither the name nor the ingredients are so unusual as to prevent inadvertent
    duplication, the mystery is likely to remain unsolved. The Democrat newspaper
    remarked in 1882 that, 'It is but a short time ago that a mixture of whiskey,
    vermouth and bitters came into vogue' and observed that it had been known as a
    Turf Club cocktail, a Jockey Club cocktail and a Manhattan cocktail. Until fairly
    recently, the most popular story was that the drink was created in November 1874
    at New York City's Manhattan Club for Lady Randolph Churchill (ne Jenny Jerome),
    while she was celebrating the successful gubernatorial campaign of Samuel Jones
    Tilden. (The Manhattan Club was opposite the site which now houses the Empire
    State Building.) However, David Wondrich has pointed out that the banquet in question
    was held in November 1874, when Lady C was otherwise engaged, in England, giving
    birth to Winston. A 1945 article claims that a drink under the name of the Manhattan
    appeared in an 1860 bar guide; it certainly appears in Harry Johnson's book of
    1884. A plausible story comes from a book published in 1923, 'Valentine's Manual
    of New York'. In this a William F. Mulhall who was a bartender at New York's Hoffman
    House in the 1880s recounts, &quot;The Manhattan cocktail was invented by a man
    named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway in the
    [eighteen] sixties - probably the most famous drink in the world in its time.&quot;
    Yet another story involves a Col. Joe Walker on a yachting trip in New York but
    as this specifically refers to sweet vermouth I have recounted it under 'Manhattan
    Sweet'.

  comment: The Manhattan version most popularly served - medium dry.
  aka: 
  variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Sweet. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned
    glass.
  origin: Whatever the truth of its invention (see Manhattan Dry), the Manhattan was
    probably originally made with rye whiskey, rather than bourbon, as New York was
    a rye-drinking city, although early bar books just state 'whiskey'. Today it is
    common to use bourbon, although purists are beginning to revive rye. When Scotch
    is substituted for bourbon the Manhattan becomes a Rob Roy, with brandy (cognac)
    it becomes a Harvard and with applejack it is a Star Cocktail when made with applejack.
    Some time in 2005 it became conventional in some New York bars to garnish a Manhattan
    with two cherries as a 9/11 tribute.

  aka: 
  variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Perfect. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned
    glass.
  origin: 'Various origins for this drink abound. They include: in November 1874 at
    New York City''s Manhattan Club for Lady Randolph Churchill. Sometime in the 1880s
    "by a man named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway
    in the [eighteen] sixties", and by a Col. Joe Walker on a yachting trip in New
    York. That last story is the most recent I have come across and comes courtesy
    of Barry Popik''s website barrypopik.com where Barry notes an entry in the Daily
    Journal, Racine, Wisconsin, 8 March 1899. The article purports that Col. Joe Walker
    ran the then-famous Crescent Hall Saloon in New Orleans, at the corner of Canal
    and St. Charles Streets and that some years before he went on a little yachting
    trip with a party of friends while in New York. "By some oversight the liquid
    refreshments in the icebox were confined to Italian vermouth and plain whisky,
    and it occurred to the colonel that a palatable drink might be made by mixing
    the two. The results were so good that he experimented a little on his return
    to New Orleans, and soon perfected the Manhattan cocktail, as it is known today.
    It was christened in honor of his friends on Manhattan island, and the fame of
    the decoction soon spread all over the country. The true Manhattan cocktail is
    always made with Italian vermouth, but at half the places where they undertake
    to serve them, French [dry] vermouth is substituted, and the fine flavor is altogether
    destroyed. French vermouth is a sort of wine, while Italian vermouth is a cordial,
    pure and simple. They are as different as milk and molasses. A cocktail made from
    the French brand is no more a Manhattan cocktail than it is a Spanish omelette."'

  aka: 
  variant: Margaritas made with premium tequilas are sometimes referred to as 'Deluxe'
    or 'Cadillac' Margaritas.
  origin: 'The Margarita can be considered a Tequila Sour, or a Tequila Sidecar, and
    two variations of this classic cocktail date back to the 1930s: the Tequila Daisy
    and the Picador. Both, however, lack the distinctive salt rim. There are many
    people who claim to have invented the Margarita, which, as Spanish for ''daisy''
    and a popular woman''s name, would have been a very common name for a drink. A
    brief summary of the top claimants: Francisco ''Pancho'' Morales, while working
    in a bar called Tommy''s Place in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was asked to make a ''Magnolia''
    on the 4th July 1942, but couldn''t remember it so created this drink. The customer''s
    name may even have been Margarita. Carlos ''Danny'' Herrera created the cocktail
    either in 1947 or 1948 at his Rancho La Gloria bar in Rosarito, Mexico, for an
    actress called Marjorie King who drank no spirit but tequila. He added Cointreau
    and lime, and the unique salt rim that caught people''s attention at the bar,
    then named his creation Margarita, the Spanish for Marjorie. Daniel (Danny) Negrete
    created the drink in 1936 when he was the manager of Garci Crespo Hotel in Puebla,
    Mexico. His girlfriend, Margarita, apparently liked salt in her drinks and he
    is said to have created the drink for her as a present. In 1944 Danny moved to
    Tijuana, Mexico, and became a bartender at the Agua Caliente Racetrack, a place
    which has some claim to be the birthplace of the Margarita in the early 1930s.
    Vernon Underwood was president of Young''s Market Company, who in the 1930s had
    started distributing Cuervo tequila. He went to Johnny Durlesser, head bartender
    of the Tail O'' The Cock in LA, and asked him to create something using his spirit,
    then named it after his wife Margaret (Margarita). Sara Morales, an expert in
    Mexican folklore, claimed the Margarita was created in 1930 by Do~na Bertha, owner
    of Bertha''s Bar in Taxco, Mexico. The socialite Margaret Sames held a Christmas
    party in Acapulco, Mexico, in 1948, and created the first Margarita. She thought
    nothing of it until, when flying home to San Antonio from Acapulco airport, she
    saw a bar advertising ''Margarita''s Drink'', a cocktail with exactly the same
    ingredients as her own. So... Plenty of Margarets and even Margaritas: there is
    also a popular holiday destination called Margarita Island, located in the Caribbean
    north of Venezuela, two-and-a-half hours from Miami. It could simply be a twist
    on the ''Daisy'', a classic cocktail dating back to Victorian times and made with
    citrus juice, sweetened with a syrup or liqueur, and fortified with a base spirit.
    Margarita is the Spanish word for daisy. A British antecedent of the Margarita
    called a ''Picador'' has recently been unearthed.'

  variant: ''
  origin: Probably the forerunner of the Martini, the first known recipe for this
    drink appears in O.H. Byron's 1884 'The Modern Bartender' where it is listed as
    a variation to the Manhattan. Its first written standalone listing in a recipe
    book appears in Harry Johnson's 1888 Bartender's Manual. Drinks historian David
    Wondrich and others believe it was first made using Dutch oude genever as this
    was the style of exported to America long before English Old Tom gin or London
    Dry gins. Although the drink appears in his 1887 Bartenders' Guide (as a variation),
    there is no evidence that Jerry Thomas invented the Martinez and significantly
    he omits the drink from the earlier 1862 edition of his Bartender's Guide. Many
    claim that one Julio Richelieu created the drink in 1874 for a goldminer and that
    the drink is named after the Californian town of Martinez, where that unnamed
    goldminer enjoyed this libation.

  garnish: The 'Oliver Twist' choice between an olive (stuffed or otherwise) or a
    lemon zest twist is traditional and these are the two most common garnishes for
    a Dry Martini. There are, however, a number of variants. A 'Dickens' is a Martini
    without a twist, a 'Gibson' is a Martini with two onions instead of an olive or
    a twist and a 'Franklin Martini' is named after Franklin Roosevelt and has two
    olives.
  glass: Martini
  comment: The proportion of gin to vermouth is a matter of taste; some say 7 to 1,
    others that one drop is sufficient. I recommend you ask the drinker how they would
    like their Martini, in the same manner that you might ask how they have their
    steak. If the drinker orders a 'Sweet Martini', use sweet red vermouth rather
    than dry and use a cherry as garnish instead of an olive.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'The Martini and its origins is a topic that can raise temperatures among
    drinks aficionados and, as so often, no one really knows. Today the drink is a
    blend of dry gin or vodka with a hint of dry vermouth. Yet it seems to have evolved
    from the Manhattan via the Martinez, a rather sweet drink based on Dutch genever
    or Old Tom gin with the addition of sweet vermouth, curacao and orange bitters.
    The Martini, like the Martinez, was initially sweet, not dry (hence the need to
    specify that its descendant was a ''Dry'' Martini), and very heavy on the vermouth
    by modern standards. Martinis were known in the late 1880s but the Dry Martini
    most likely appeared with the emergence of the London Dry gin style. In 1906 Louis
    Muckenstrum wrote about a dry Martini Cocktail which, like the Martinez, benefited
    from curacao and bitters as well as vermouth. Yet, unlike earlier versions, both
    the gin and the vermouth were dry. According to Gary Regan, the marketers at Martini
    &amp; Rosso vermouth were advertising a Dry Martini cocktail heavily at that time.
    One myth attributes the creation of the Dry Martini to one Martini di Arma di
    Taggia,, head bartender at New York''s Knickerbocker Hotel, in 1911, although
    this is clearly too late. It is also no longer believed that the name relates
    to Martini &amp; Henry rifles, the first of which was launched in 1871. The Dry
    Martini seems to have got drier and drier over the years. Curacao rapidly left
    the drink, but orange bitters remained a usual ingredient until the 1940s (interestingly,
    these are now coming back into vogue in some bars).There is some debate as to
    whether a Martini should be shaken or stirred. It should be stirred. If shaken,
    it becomes a ''Bradford''. Shaking the drink increases the dilution and introduces
    air bubbles into the drink, making it taste fresher and colder but making the
    drink appear cloudy due to the introduction of tiny air bubbles. The following
    are some of the most popular variations on the classic Dry Martini: Dickens''
    Martini - without a twist.Dirty Martini - with the brine from an olive jar.Franklin
    Martini - named after Franklin Roosevelt and served with two olives.Gibson Martini
    - with two cocktail olives.Vesper Martini - James Bond''s Martini, made with gin
    and vodka. Vodkatini - very dry, vodka based Martini.Wet Martini - heavy on the
    vermouth.'

    to coat the ice with vermouth. POUR frozen gin into glass and serve immediately.

  garnish: Chilled olive on stick or lemon zest twist
  glass: Martini
  comment: Dilution is achieved as the water you have frozen in the glass begins to
    melt. Both glass and gin must be freezing cold so that the temperature masks the
    strength of the alcohol. You have been warned!
  aka: Diamond Martini
  variant: Use an atomiser to coat glass with vermouth. Based on vodka.
  origin: After the Second World War, vermouth proportions in the classic Dry Martini
    dropped rapidly, and this 'Naked' style of serve began to appear. Tradionally
    both vermouth and gin had been stirred with ice. In a Naked Martini the merest
    hint of vermouth is swirled around a well-chilled glass and then frozen gin is
    poured into the vermouth-coated glass. The trick to a good Naked Martini is still
    achieving some dilution by the addition of a splash of water in the glass before
    freezing. This is a trick I learnt from Salvatore Calabrese, who originally tended
    bar at London's Duke's Hotel - famous for its Dry Martinis.

    (during Prohibition) by Fred Kaufman at the Hotel Nac^ional de Cuba, Havana for
    the silent movie star and wife of Douglas Fairbanks. Mary was in Cuba filming
    a movie with her husband Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. This is recounted
    on page 40 of Basil Woon's 1928 book 'When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba': &quot;The
    Mary Pickford, invented during a visit to Havana of the screen favourite by Fred
    Kaufman, is two-thirds pineapple-juice and one-third Bacardi, with a dash of grenadine.
    Both cocktails [The Presidente is also mentioned] are sweetish and should be well
    shaken. The Pineapple juice must be fresh-squeezed.&quot; Thus it would appear
    that a dash of maraschino liqueur is a later addition."

  origin: Named after The Hotel Metropole, located just off Times Square at 147 West
    43rd Street. This was the first hotel in New York City to have running water in
    every room but had a less than salubrious reputation due to the clientele its
    all-night licensed street-level Caf Metropole attracted. As Albert Stevens Crockett
    says in his 1935, 'The Old Waldorf Bar Days', "Attributed to a once well known
    and somewhat lively hotel, whose bar was a long centre of life after dark in the
    Times Square district." In the early morning hours of 16th July 1912 Herman Rosenthal,
    the owner of several New York gambling dens, was murdered as he left Caf Metropole
    (a crime recounted in the story of the Jack Rose). Just one week after the murder,
    The Hotel Metropole went bankrupt, later to become became the Hotel Rosoff.

    light Mexican lager. Even the spicy ingredients vary but the hot pepper sauce

  variant: 
  origin: Michael Romanoff (1890-1971) was a Hollywood impresario. Born Hershel Geguzin
    in Lithuania he immigrated to New York City aged ten and changed his name to Harry
    F. Gerguson. He moved to Hollywood where he took on the Michael Romanoff persona,
    claiming to be born Prince Michael Alexandrovitch Dimitri Obolensky Romanoff,
    nephew of Tsar Nicholas II. Scotland Yard described the former British and French
    convict as a "rouge of uncertain nationality." He was another actor in a town
    of actors and when a filmmaker needed a 'technical adviser' for a movie set in
    Europe, Romanoff was the obvious well paid expert. He was a popular Hollywood
    figure and he opened Romanoff's, a Beverly Hills restaurant popular with movie
    stars in the 1940s and 1950s. Humphrey Bogart was a good friend of Romanoff and
    a regular at the restaurant. Hollywood legend has it that one day in 1955 Bogie
    was lunching with Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Jimmy Van Heusen when Mrs Bogart,
    A.K.A. Lauren Bacall walked into the restaurant and on seeing the group exclaimed,
    &quot;I see the rat pack is all here&quot;. Thus Romanoff's became the place where
    the Rat Pack term was first coined and also where this drink was created. David
    Niven was also a close friend and in his book 'Bring on the Empty Horses' he devotes
    chapter eight, 'The Emperor', to the colourful Romanoff.

  comment: When well made, this Cuban cousin of the Mint Julep is one of the world's

  aka: 
  variant: Add two dashes Angostura aromatic bitters
  origin: The exact origins of the Mojito and its name are lost in the mists of time.
    Some trace it back to 1586 and a medicinal drink named after Sir Francis Drake.
    He was one of a band of privateers sponsored by England's Queen Elizabeth I to
    plunder Spanish cities in the New World and seize their riches. Cuba was under
    Spanish rule and King Philip II of Spain had warned his governor in Cuba that
    he believed Drake intended to raid Havana in order to seize the Aztec gold stored
    in the city's royal treasury. Thus Havana was well defended but there was still
    surprised relief in the city when, after several days of waiting, Drake sailed
    away from the richest port in the West Indies after firing only a few shots. Drake
    left Havana and its gold intact, but his visit was a major event - something perhaps
    worthy of naming a drink after. Others say the drink was not originally Cuban
    and it was actually invented upon board Drake's ship which carried mint to mix
    with cane spirit, sugar and lime to make a drink to relieve fever and colds. What
    is for certain is that the Draque, Drak or Drac was certainly drunk for its perceived
    medicinal value. During one of the worst cholera epidemics ever to hit Havana,
    the author Ramon de Paula wrote, "Every day at eleven o' clock I consume a little
    Drake made from aguardiente (local cane spirit) and I am doing very well." At
    some time in the late 1890s the local cane spirit in the Draque was replaced with
    Bacardi Carta Blanca rum and over the decades the drink started to be made long.
    This is supported by Frederick Villoch in 1940 "...when aguardiente was replaced
    with rum, the Drake was to be called a Mojito." However, some still maintain the
    Mojito was invented after Americans visiting Cuba's thriving bar culture between
    the wars, and especially during Prohibition, introduced the locals to the Mint
    Julep. The origins of the name 'Mojito' are equally misty. Some say it comes from
    'mojar', a Spanish verb suggesting wetness. Others claim it comes from the African
    word 'mojo', meaning spell. Bodeguita del Medio bar in Havana is by urban myth
    credited with the first Mojito and this is apparently where Ernest Hemingway went
    for his. The great man wrote of Cuba's unofficial national drink, "it wasn't just
    a drink; it was a symbol of national pride."

  comment: A long, vodka based drink with spice provided by ginger beer and Angostura.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: This classic combination was born in 1941. John G. Martin had acquired the
    rights to Smirnoff vodka for Heublein, a small Connecticut based liquor and food
    distributor. Jack Morgan, the owner of Hollywood's famous Cock'n'Bull Saloon,
    was trying to launch his own brand of ginger beer. The two men met at New York
    City's Chatham Bar and hit on the idea of mixing Martin's vodka with Morgan's
    ginger beer and adding a dash of lime to create a new cocktail, the Moscow Mule.
    To help promote the drink, and hence their respective products, Morgan had the
    idea of marketing the Moscow Mule using specially engraved mugs. The five ounce
    mugs were embossed with a kicking mule and made at a copper factory a friend of
    his had recently inherited. The promotion helped turn Smirnoff into a major brand.

  variant: 'Old Fashioned #2 (US Version)'
  origin: As with the Martini, the glass this cocktail is served in has taken the
    name of the drink. The cocktails creation is credited to a bartender called Martin
    Cuneo at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky. USA. He is said to have made
    the drink for a Kentucky Colonel (and bourbon distiller) named James E. Pepper
    sometime between 1889 and 1895. In those days the clubhouse was situated at in
    the old Belknap family mansion located between Third and Fourth Streets on the
    south side of Walnut Street (now Muhammad Ali Blvd.) in Louisville. This was torn
    down and replaced by the current opulent Georgian clubhouse, located about a block
    to the east, at 218 West Walnut Street, which opened in late 1928.A number of
    sources collaborate the Old Fashioned originating the Pendennis Club, including
    the 1931 book, Old Waldorf Bar Days, in which it author, Albert Stevens Crocket,
    writes of this drink, &quot;This was brought to the Old Waldorf in the days of
    the 'sit-down' Bar, and was introduced by, or in the honor of, Col. James E. Pepper,
    of Kentucky, a proprietor of a celebrated whiskey of the period. It was said to
    have been the invention of a bartender at the famous Pendennis Club in Louisville,
    of which Col. Pepper was a member.&quot;

  variant: 'Old Fashioned #1 (Classic Version)'
  origin: 'In the US orange segments and sometimes even a maraschino cherry are regularly
    muddled in this drink: the practice probably originated during Prohibition as
    a means of disguising rough spirits. This practice is almost unknown in England
    and as Crosby Gaige wrote in 1944, "Serious-minded persons omit fruit salad from
    Old Fashioneds."'

  comment: You've not properly experienced an English summer until you've drunk one
    of these whilst sheltering from the rain.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'This quintessential English summer tipple is usually accredited to James
    Pimm, who in 1823-4 began trading as a shellfish-monger in London''s Lombard Street.
    He later moved to nearby number 3 Poultry, also in the City of London, where he
    established Pimm''s Oyster Warehouse. It is here, in 1840, that he is said to
    have first served this drink. Others dispute this, maintaining that James Pimm
    only unwittingly lent his name to the drink. They say the true credit lies with
    his successor, Samuel Morey, who is recorded as having taken out a retail liquor
    licence in 1860. This would appear to be when the oyster bar first offered its
    customers spirits. Many establishments of the day mixed house spirits to serve
    with liqueurs and juices as ''cups'', in reference to the tankards in which they
    were sold. Naturally the ''cup'' made at Pimm''s Oyster Bar was named after the
    establishment which retained the goodwill of its founder. Pimm''s restaurant became
    very popular and changed hands a couple more times. Eventually Horatio David Davies,
    a wine merchant and owner of cafes in London bought the business. He became Sir
    Horatio, a Member of Parliament and between 1897-1898, Lord Mayor of London. He
    formed Pimm''s into a private company in 1906, which, was controlled by family
    trusts for another 57 years after his death. The precise date that the drink Pimm''s
    was first sold outside restaurants and bars controlled by the Pimm''s company
    is unknown. However, it is certain that the original product, No.1, was based
    on gin and flavoured with numerous botanicals including quinine. A second Pimm''s
    product based on Scotch (Pimm''s No.2 Cup) was launched and a third (Pimm''s No.3
    Cup) was based on brandy. Pimm''s became popular in Britain in the 1920s and took
    off internationally after the Second World War. Other versions were then introduced:
    Pimm''s No.4 based on rum, Pimm''s No.6 on vodka and Pimm''s No.7 on rye whiskey.'

  origin: Three Puerto Rican bartenders contest the ownership of this drink. Ramn
    Marrero Prez claims to have first made it at the Caribe Hilton hotel's Beachcomber
    Bar in San Juan on 15th August 1954 using the then newly available Coco Lpez cream
    of coconut. Ricardo Garcia, who also worked at the Caribe, says that it was he
    who invented the drink. But Ramn Portas Mingot says he created it in 1963 at the
    Barrachina Bar in Old San Juan. It is, however, commonly accepted that the Pi~na
    Colada was adapted from an existing creation at the Caribe Hilton Hotel, which
    has since promoted itself as the home of the drink and today credits Ramn Marrero
    Prez with its invention. Puerto Rico's famous Caribe Hilton Hotel sits on a 17-acre
    peninsula near Old San Juan. It was the first luxury hotel to open in the region
    and was a popular destination for the rich and famous who helped spread word of
    the drink. The name 'Pi~na Colada' literally means 'strained pineapple', a reference
    to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation.
    Another essential ingredient, 'cream of coconut', is a canned, non-alcoholic,
    thick, syrup-like blend of coconut juice, sugar, emulsifier, cellulose, thickeners,
    citric acid and salt.

  comment: Normally I'd advocate liberal use of bitters but this refined and subtle

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Gin was a favourite of the Royal Navy - along with rum, which was served
    as a daily ration right up until the 70s. It was often mixed with healthy ingredients
    to make them more palatable. Pink gin was originally used against stomach upsets,
    as Angostura aromatic bitters were considered medicinal. Traditionally this drink
    was made in a bitters swashed glass without the use of ice.

    Myers. The recipe on the back of each bottles is known as the 'Old Plantation
    formula' and uses classic rum punch proportions of 1 sour (lime), 2 sweet (sugar),
    3 strong (rum) and 4 weak (water). Rather than this or the American formula (
    1 sour, 2 sweet, 3 weak, and 4 strong), I've followed David A. Embury's recommendation
    of 1 sweet, 2 sour, 3 strong and 4 weak.

  comment: Two traditional punches remain on today's cocktail lists, the 'Rum Punch'
    and the 'Hot Whisky Punch', now better known as the 'Hot Toddy'. Also bear in
    mind that the Gin Punch probably led to the creation of the Collins.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'Long before the Martini, the V-shaped glass and the cocktail shaker, the
    drink of choice at society gatherings was punch and the punch bowl was the centre
    of activity at every party. Punch had existed in India for centuries before colonialists
    brought it back to Europe some time in the latter half of the 1600s. The name
    derives from the Hindi word for five, ''panch'', and refers to the five key ingredients:
    alcohol, citrus, sugar, water and spices. In India, it was made with arrack (the
    Arabic word for liquor and a local spirit distilled from palm sap or sugar cane).
    Back in Britain it was common for punches to be spiced with nutmeg or tea. The
    classic proportions of a punch follow a mnemonic, ''one of sour, two of sweet,
    three of strong and four of weak.'' It refers to lime juice, sugar, rum and water
    - the fifth element, spice was added to taste. The basic punch principle of balancing
    sweet and sour with spirit and dilution remains key to making a good cocktail
    to this day. Indeed, the essential punch ingredients - spirit, citrus, sugar and
    water - lie at the centre of most modern day cocktails including the Daiquiri,
    Sour, Margarita, Caipirinha and Sidecar. Today''s bartenders are now also reintroducing
    the fifth punch ingredient by muddling or macerating herbs and spices in their
    cocktails.'

  comment: Looks like a Bloody Mary but features gin's aromatic botanicals.
  aka: 
  variant: Bloody Mary
  origin: 'Today, the term Red Snapper means a Bloody Mary made with gin instead of
    vodka. But the first known recipes, from the 1940s, describe a 50-50 blend of
    vodka and tomato juice, with spices, just like an early Bloody Mary: one book
    even states that the Red Snapper is identical to the Bloody Mary. Cocktail lore
    states that the Bloody Mary was officially renamed the Red Snapper at the St.
    Regis Hotel, at some point after the fabulously wealthy Vincent Astor bought it
    in 1935. Fernand Petiot, who most likely created the original drink (see ''Bloody
    Mary''), was working there, but Astor apparently found the title too crude for
    his clientele and insisted the drink be renamed. Customers, of course, continued
    to order Bloody Marys, but the Red Snapper found a drink of its own in due course.'

    spice added. Scarily, it took 14 attempts and 13 wasted drinks to arrive at the

  variant: 
  origin: Created in 2008 by Yours Truly (Simon Difford) at the Cabinet Room, London,
    England. James Bond named his favourite style of Martini after the beautiful Russian
    agent Vesper Lynd. This version is 'Reversed' due to the dramatically increased
    ratio of Lillet. It mixes east and west ingredients with the introduction of Becherovka,
    and where there is Becherovka there should be tonic water.

    a Collins with lemon juice. A Rickey is also usually served in a shorter glass
    than a Collins but that difference is secondary.

    flavour of this classic New Orleans cocktail is reliant on one essential ingredient:
    Peychaud's aromatic bitters created by one Antoine Amedee Peychaud. His story
    starts in 1795 when he arrives in New Orleans as a refugee in 1795 after his father
    was forced to flee the island of San Domingo, where his family owned a coffee
    plantation, after the slaves rebelled.Antoine grew up to become a pharmacist and
    bought his own drug and apothecary store at 437 Rue Royale (then No. 123 Royal
    Street) in 1834. Here he created an 'American Aromatic Bitter Cordial' and marketed
    it as a medicinal tonic. Such potions were fashionable at the time and there were
    many similar products.Antoine also served his bitters mixed with brandy and other
    liquors. (It has been falsely claimed that the word 'cocktail' originated with
    Antoine, from a measure known as a 'coquetier' he used to prepare drinks. But
    it is now undisputed that the term appeared in print in an upstate New York newspaper
    in 1806, when Antoine was still a child.)Antoine Peychaud advertised his bitters
    in local newspapers and many New Orleans bars served drinks prepared with them.
    One such bar was the Sazerac Coffee House at 13 Exchange Alley, owned by John
    B. Schiller, also the local agent for a French cognac company 'Sazerac-du-Forge
    et Fils' of Limoges. It was here, sometime between 1850 and 1859, that a bartender
    called Leon Lamothe is thought to have created the Sazerac, probably using Peychaud's
    aromatic bitters, Sazerac cognac and sugar.A decade or so later, one Thomas H
    Handy took over the coffee house and around the same time, Antoine Peychaud fell
    upon hard times and sold his pharmacy store, along with the formula and brand
    name of his bitters. A combination of the phylloxera aphid (which devastated French
    vineyards) and the American Civil War made cognac hard to obtain and Handy was
    forced to change the recipe of the bar's now established house cocktail. He still
    used the all-important Peychaud's bitters but substituted Maryland Club rye whiskey,
    retaining a dash of cognac and adding a splash of the newly fashionable absinthe.The
    Sazerac was further adapted in 1912 when absinthe was banned in the US and Herbsaint
    from Louisiana was substituted. Today the name Sazerac is owned by the Sazerac
    Company, who licensed the name to the Sazerac Bar at New Orleans' Fairmont Hotel."

    'shant of gatter' (shanty being a public house, gatter meaning water). The ginger
    ale serves as a flavoursome way to water down the strength of the beer, thus the
    literal translation, 'pub water'. In the first chapter of The History of Mr. Polly,
    H. G. Wells describes a shandygaff as being, "two pints of beer and two bottles
    of ginger beer foaming in a huge round-bellied jug." In London the beer is now
    usually diluted with lemonade and this drink is now simply known as a shandy.
    When ordering in a pub you are expected to call for 'lager shandy' or 'bitter
    shandy', the latter specifying the drink should be based on traditional real ale.
    Today the term 'Shandygaff' is forgotten in London but popular in the Caribbean
    where this drink is made with beer and ginger ale or ginger beer.

  comment: Complex and very slightly on the sour side of balanced. Those with a sweet
    tooth may prefer with a sugar rim.There have been periods when it has been fashionable
    to coat the rim of the glass in which this drink is to be served with sugar. Thankfully
    sugar rims are now out of vogue and, as Embury writes in his book, "A twist of
    lemon may be used if desired and the peel dropped into the glass. Otherwise no
    decoration."
  aka: 
  variant: Apple Cart
  origin: 'In his 1948 ''Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'', David A. Embury writes of the
    Sidecar: "It was invented by a friend of mine at a bar in Paris during World War
    I and was named after the motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain customarily
    was driven to and from the little bistro where the drink was born and christened."
    Embury doesn''t name the bar but it''s commonly assumed that he meant Harry''s
    New York Bar and that the cocktail was created by its owner, Harry MacElhone.
    However, in Harry''s own book he credits the drink to Pat MacGarry of Buck''s
    Club, London. The proportions of this drink are debated as much as its origin.
    Perhaps due to ease rather than balance, the equal parts formula (1 x brandy,
    1 x triple sec and 1 x lemon juice) was the earliest published recipe (Robert
    Vermeire''s 1922 ''Cocktails: How to Mix Them'' and Harry McElhone''s 1922 ''ABC
    of mixing cocktails'') and still seems popular to this day. Embury writes of the
    ''equal parts'' Sidecar, "This is the most perfect example of a magnificent drink
    gone wrong". He argues that "Essentially the Sidecar is nothing but a Daiquiri
    with brandy in the place of rum and Cointreau in the place of sugar syrup" and
    so the Daiquiri formula should be followed (2 x brandy, 1/2 x triple sec and 1/4
    lemon juice). This may work for a Daiquiri but makes for an overly dry Sidecar.
    In his 1930 ''The Savoy Cocktail Book'', Harry Craddock calls for 2 x brandy;
    1 x Cointreau and 1 x lemon juice. The formula I use here takes the middle ground
    between The Savoy and the ''equal parts'' camp. I also find this drink benefits
    from a little extra dilution.'

  origin: Adapted from a recipe by Charles H. Baker Jr. and published in his 1946
    Gentleman's Companion. This drink was created some time between 1911 and 1915
    by Chinese-born Ngiam Tong Boon at the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel, Singapore. Raffles
    Hotel is named after the colonial founder of Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles,
    and was the Near East's ex-pat central. As Charles H. Baker Jr. wrote in his 1946
    Gentleman's Companion, "Just looking around the terrace porch we've seen Frank
    Buck, the Sultan of Johor, Aimee Semple McPherson, Somerset Maugham, Dick Halliburton,
    Doug Fairbanks, Bob Ripley, Ruth Elder and Walker Camp - not that this is any
    wonder". Raffles still sticks out of modern-day Singapore like a vast, colonial
    Christmas cake. Although there is little controversy as to who created the Singapore
    Sling, where he created it and (roughly) when, there is huge debate over the original
    name and ingredients. Singapore and the locality was colonially known as the 'Straits
    Settlements' and it seems certain that Boon's drink was similarly named the 'Straits
    Sling'. The name appears to have changed sometime between 1922 and 1930. Not even
    the Raffles Hotel itself appears sure of the original recipe and visiting the
    present day Long Bar in search of enlightenment is hopeless. Sadly, the Singapore
    Slings now served there are made from a powdered pre-mix, which is also available
    in the gift shop below.While contemporary sources are clear that it was cherry
    brandy that distinguishes the Singapore Sling from another kind of sling, a great
    debate rages over the type of cherry brandy used. Was it a cherry 'brandy' liqueur
    or actually a cherry eau de vie? Did fruit juice feature in the original recipe
    at all? We shall probably never know, so I've listed several versions which are
    generally accepted to pass for a Singapore Sling today. Please also see the entry
    for 'Straits Sling'.

  comment: Sugar balances the citrus juice, the spirit fortifies and the carbonate

  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: The word 'Sling' comes from the German 'schlingen', meaning 'to swallow',
    and Slings based on a spirit mixed with sugar and water were popularly drunk in
    the late 1800s.Slings are similar to Toddies and like Toddies can be served hot.
    (Toddies, however, are never served cold.) The main difference between a Toddy
    and a Sling is that Slings are not flavoured by the addition of spices. Also,
    Toddies tend to be made with plain water, while Slings are charged with water,
    soda water or ginger ale.The earliest known definition of 'cocktail' describes
    it as a bittered sling.

  comment: 'This 4:2:8 formula is a tad sourer than the classic 3:4:8 which translates
    as: three quarter part of the sour ingredient (lemon juice), one part of the sweet
    ingredient (sugar syrup) and two parts of the strong ingredient (spirit). So if
    you find my formula to sour than best follow the classic proportions in future.'
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: Sours are aptly named drinks. Their flavour comes from either lemon or lime
    juice, which is balanced with sugar. Sours can be based on practically any spirit
    but the bourbon based Whiskey Sour is by far the most popular. Many (including
    myself) believe this drink is only properly made when smoothed with a little egg
    white.Sours are served either straight-up in a Sour glass (rather like a small
    flute) or on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass. They are traditionally garnished
    with a cherry and an orange slice, or sometimes a lemon slice.

  origin: Swizzles originated in the Caribbean. They are sour style drinks that, distinctively,
    must be churned with a swizzle stick.Originally a twig from a species of tree
    called Quararibea turbinata which grow in the southern islands of the Caribbean.
    These trees have forked branches, which make perfect swizzle sticks. Today swizzle
    sticks are usually made of metal or plastic and have several blades or fingers
    attached to the base at right angles to the shaft. To use one, simply immerse
    the blades in the drink, hold the shaft between the palms of both hands and rotate
    the stick rapidly by sliding your hands back and forth against it. If you do not
    have a bona fide swizzle stick, use a barspoon in the same manner.Swizzles can
    be served as short drinks or lengthened with mineral water.

    the drink down in one while it is still fizzing.

  aka: 
  variant: With cream soda or ginger ale.
  origin: 'Originally topped with ginger ale and not champagne, this infamous libation
    is thought to have started out as a Hell''s Angel drink - it needs no ice and
    can be carried in a bike bag. The simplest slammer is a lick of salt, a shot of
    tequila and then a bite of lemon (or lime). A Bermuda Slammer involves straight
    tequila, salt, a slice of lemon and a partner: one has to lick the salt off the
    other one''s neck and bite the lemon (held between their partner''s teeth) before
    downing a shot of tequila. To quote Victor Bergeron (Trader Vic), "You know, this
    rigmarole with a pinch of salt and lemon juice and tequila - in whatever order
    - was originally for a purpose: It''s hot in Mexico. People dehydrate themselves.
    And they need more salt. Here, it''s not so hot, and we don''t need salt in the
    same way. So you can drink tequila straight right out of the bottle, if you want
    to."'

  comment: 'This drink only works with authentic agricole rum and sugar cane juice.
    On its native islands it is usual to use rhum blanc (unaged white agricole rum)
    during the day and rhum vieux (aged agricole rum) during the evening.Note: Traditionally
    the limes used to make this drink are not cut into slices or wedges. Instead a
    round disc is cut from the side of the fruit. These are cut large enough that
    some of the fruits pulp backs the peel on the disc.'
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'Named Ti from the French word ''Petit'', this is literally a small rum
    punch: unlike most rum punches, it is not lengthened with water or juice. It is
    popular in the French islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Runion and Maurice where
    it''s often drunk straight down without adding ice and chased by a large glass
    of chilled water (called a ''crase'' in Martinique ). These islands are also home
    to Rhum Agricole (a style of rum distilled only from sugar cane juice and usually
    bottled at 50% alc./vol.)'

    by Simon Difford at the Cabinet Room, London, England. The inspiration for this
    drink came not from the similarly named discount clothing retailer but the venerable
    Tiki cocktail itself.Tiki drinks, otherwise known as 'exotics' originated in 1934
    when Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, a Louisiana native who had made some money
    bootlegging rum during Prohibition, opened a bar called Don's Beachcomber in Hollywood
    and began serving rum based, fruity cocktails. Soon after, Victor 'Trader Vic'
    Bergeron transformed his restaurant Hinky Dinks into a similar faux Polynesian
    style. These founding fathers spawned many Tiki imitators and despite a dip in
    popularity from the 1970s, happily the Noughties saw a revival in the fortunes
    of Tiki."

    is traditionally credited to John Collins, a bartender who worked at Limmer's
    Hotel, Conduit Street, London. The 'coffee house' of this hotel, a true dive bar,
    was popular with sporting types during the 19th century, and famous, according
    to the 1860s memoirs of a Captain Gronow, for its gin-punch as early as 1814.John
    (or possibly Jim) Collins, head waiter of Limmer's, is immortalised in a limerick,
    which was apparently first printed in an 1892 book entitled 'Drinks of the World'.
    In 1891 a Sir Morell Mackenzie had identified John Collins as the creator of the
    Tom Collins, using this limerick, although both the words of the rhyme and the
    conclusions he drew from it were disputed. But, according to this version of the
    story, the special gin-punch for which John Collins of Limmer's was famous went
    on to become known as the Tom Collins when it was made using Old Tom gin.Others
    say that the Tom Collins originated in New York, and takes its name from the Great
    Tom Collins Hoax of 1874, a practical joke which involved telling a friend that
    a man named Tom Collins had been insulting them, and that he could be found in
    a bar some distance away, and took the city by storm. This is supported by the
    fact that the first known written occurrence of a Tom Collins cocktail recipe
    is found in the 1876 edition of Jerry Thomas' 'The Bartender's Guide'. Three drinks
    titled Tom Collins are listed: Tom Collins Whiskey, Tom Collins Brandy and Tom
    Collins Gin.An alternative story attributes the drink to a Collins who started
    work at a New York tavern called the Whitehouse in 1873 and started pouring a
    thirst quencher made with gin. Another identifies a different Tom Collins, who
    worked as a bartender in New Jersey and New York area. There are apparently also
    versions of its creation in San Francisco and Australia, and it is not impossible
    that the drink evolved in two or more places independently."

  comment: Many bartenders advocate that a Martini should be stirred and not shaken,
    some citing the ridiculous argument that shaking will "bruise the gin". If you
    like your Martinis shaken (as I do) then avoid the possible look of distaste from
    your server and order a Vesper. This Martini is always shaken, an action that
    aerates the drink, and makes it colder and more dilute than simply stirring. It
    also gives the drink a slightly clouded appearance and can leave small shards
    of ice on the surface of the drink. This is easily prevented by the use of a fine
    strainer when pouring.
  aka: 
  variant: 
  origin: 'This variation on the Dry Martini is said to have been created by Gilberto
    Preti at Duke''s Hotel, London, for the author Ian Fleming. He liked it so much
    that he included it in his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, published in
    1951. In chapter seven Bond explains to a Casino bartender exactly how to make
    and serve the drink: "In a deep champagne goblet. Three measures of Gordon''s,
    one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet [now called Lillet Blanc]. Shake it
    very well until it''s ice-cold, then add a large slice of lemon peel." When made,
    007 compliments the bartender, but tells him it would be better made with a grain-based
    vodka. He also explains his Martini to Felix Leiter, the CIA man, saying, &quot;This
    drink''s my own invention. I''m going to patent it when I can think of a good
    name.&quot; In chapter eight, Bond meets the beautiful agent Vesper Lynd. She
    explains why her parents named her Vesper and Bond asks if she''d mind if he called
    his favourite Martini after her. Like so many of Bond''s love interests Vesper
    turns out to be a double agent and the book closes with his words, "The bitch
    is dead now."'

  origin: The eponymous cocktail from the Waldorf Hotel occupied a site on New York's

    landmark Art-Deco building at 301 Park Avenue. Consisting of equal parts whiskey
    (probably originally rye), sweet vermouth and absinthe with a dash of bitters.
    This is the earlier of the two classic versions of this vintage cocktail which
    appeared in Jacques Straub's 1914 book 'Drinks' and later in A. S. Crockett's
    1935 The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book. The recipe above is adapted to better suit

    lemon or lime juice. The original recipe calls for two parts Swedish punch to
    one part gin but with the punches I've tried this makes for an overly sweet drink.

  method: Cut the top off a small pineapple and carefully scoop out the flesh from
    the base to leave a shell with 12mm (1/2 inch) thick walls. Place the shell in
    a freezer to chill. Remove the hard core from the pineapple flesh and discard;
    roughly chop the remaining flesh, add other ingredients and BLEND with one 12oz
    scoop of crushed ice. Pour into the pineapple shell and serve with straws. (The
    flesh of one pineapple blended with the following ingredients will fill at least
    two shells).

  method: POUR absinthe into glass. PLACE cube of sugar on a slotted absinthe spoon
    resting across the top of the glass. Using a bottle of chilled mineral water with
    a small hole in the cap, DRIP water over the sugar so it dissolves and drips into
    the glass. Traditionally the same amount of sugar is added as water but I find
    full strength absinthe requires more dilution. Add ice, stir and serve.

  glass: Absinthe glass or old-fashioned
  comment: Patience is a virtue. Slow dripping of the water is essential to dissolve
    the entire sugar cube and give the drink enough sweetness to balance the absinthe.
