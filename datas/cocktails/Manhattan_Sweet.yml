comment: I must confess to preferring my Manhattans served sweet, or perfect at a
  push. The Manhattan is complex, challenging and moreish. Best of all, it's available
  in a style to suit every palate.<br /><br />
aka: 
variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Perfect. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned
  glass.
origin: 'Various origins for this drink abound. They include: in November 1874 at
  New York City''s Manhattan Club for Lady Randolph Churchill. Sometime in the 1880s
  "by a man named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway
  in the [eighteen] sixties", and by a Col. Joe Walker on a yachting trip in New York.<br
  />    <br />That last story is the most recent I have come across and comes courtesy
  of Barry Popik''s website barrypopik.com where Barry notes an entry in the Daily
  Journal, Racine, Wisconsin, 8 March 1899. The article purports that Col. Joe Walker
  ran the then-famous Crescent Hall Saloon in New Orleans, at the corner of Canal
  and St. Charles Streets and that some years before he went on a little yachting
  trip with a party of friends while in New York. "By some oversight the liquid refreshments
  in the icebox were confined to Italian vermouth and plain whisky, and it occurred
  to the colonel that a palatable drink might be made by mixing the two. The results
  were so good that he experimented a little on his return to New Orleans, and soon
  perfected the Manhattan cocktail, as it is known today. It was christened in honor
  of his friends on Manhattan island, and the fame of the decoction soon spread all
  over the country. The true Manhattan cocktail is always made with Italian vermouth,
  but at half the places where they undertake to serve them, French [dry] vermouth
  is substituted, and the fine flavor is altogether destroyed. French vermouth is
  a sort of wine, while Italian vermouth is a cordial, pure and simple. They are as
  different as milk and molasses. A cocktail made from the French brand is no more
  a Manhattan cocktail than it is a Spanish omelette."<br /><br />'
