  Comment: Even Mr Embury would approve of this version. Overproof Jamaican rum and copious amounts of bitters make this drink.
  Origin: Adapted from David A. Embury's 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', where he writes, &quot;This cocktail is supposed to have been a speciality of the elder Morgan of the House of Morgan, which goes to prove as a bartender he was an excellent banker.&quot;
