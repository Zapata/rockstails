  Comment: If you like Scotch you should try this extra malty dram. After all that stirring you'll deserve one.
  Origin: Created in 2003 by Shelim Islam at the GE Club, London, England. Shelim named this drink after a horse in the sports section of a paper (also a film made in the seventies starring Robert Redford).
