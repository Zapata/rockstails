name: Negroni
method: POUR all ingredients into ice-filled glass and STIR.
rate: 4.5
garnish: Orange zest twist
glass: Old-fashioned
comment: Bitter and dry, but very tasty. This no namby-pamby drink is traditionally
  assembled and mixed directly in the glass. There is something about this drink that
  does not suit fussing about with mixing glasses and strainers. To garnish with a
  lemon slice is a heinous crime.<br /><br />
aka: 
variant: Americano
origin: This drink takes its name from Count Camillo Negroni. In the mid-1920's, while
  drinking at the Casoni Bar in Florence, Italy, he is said to have asked for an Americano
  'with a bit more kick'.
