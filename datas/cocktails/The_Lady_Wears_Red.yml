variant: 
origin: Adapted from a drink created in 2008 by Ben Carlotto at The Voodoo Rooms,
  Edinburgh, Scotland. The original recipe calls for homemade dry orange syrup made
  by macerating orange zests in a blend of different sugars with Lillet Blanc and
  fine sherry. It also calls for homemade citrus bitters, a complex mixture of kaffir
  lime leaves, various citrus elements, and spices like cardamom and cassia.<br /><br
