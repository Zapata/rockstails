origin: 'This is a version of the drink for which Limmer''s Hotel in London was most
  famed: a Captain Gronow recalled it in his 1860s memoirs as one of the top, if filthy
  and seedy, sporting hangouts of 1814, thanks in part to its ''famous gin-punch''.
  A bartender named John Collins worked there later in the 19th century, and was famous
  enough to inspire a limerick, so many believe he created the Collins, which is similar
  to gin punch, although the drink is not named in the rhyme which goes as follows:<br
  />My name is John Collins,<br />  head waiter at Limmer''s,<br />Corner of Conduit
  Street,<br />  Hanover Square,<br />My chief occupation is filling<br />  brimmers<br
  />For all the young gentlemen<br />  frequenters there.<br /><br />'
