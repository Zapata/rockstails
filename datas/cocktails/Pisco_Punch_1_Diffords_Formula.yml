garnish: Pineapple wedge on rim
glass: Collins

  Comment: A tangy, balanced combination of rich flavours. The quality of pisco used is crucial to the success of a Pisco Punch.
  Origin: Created in 2003 by Yours Truly (Simon Difford).
  Variant: This recipe is improved by using the marinade prescribed in Alfredo Micheli's Pisco Punch in place of sugar syrup. If using the marinade drop one of the marinated pineapple wedges and cloves into the drink as the garnish.
