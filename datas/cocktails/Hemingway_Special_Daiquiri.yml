comment: A true Hemingway Special should be served without the addition of sugar.
  However, Hemingway had a hardened palate and more delicate drinkers may prefer the
  recipe above.<br /><br />
aka: Papa Doble Daiquiri
variant: 
origin: Created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert, the legendary head bartender
  of La Floridita, Havana, Cuba for Ernest Hemingway, after the great man wandered
  into the bar to use the toilet. When Hemingway tried the Floridita's standard frozen
  Daiquiri, he is quoted as saying, "That's good but I prefer it without sugar and
  with double rum," so the Hemingway Special was born.<br />        <br />Hemingway
  suffered from haemochromotosis, a rare and hereditary form of diabetes from which
  his father also suffered, hence his aversion to sugar. The original version was
  exactly as Hemingway requested a Daiquiri without sugar and heavy on the rum, basically
  rum shaken with a splash of lime juice. Years later after he took over the position
  of Head Bartender at La Floridita, Antonio Meilan added maraschino and grapefruit
  juice into the drink. Today sugar is commonly also added to balance this drink and
  make it more palatable to people with less sour palates than Hemingway.<br />        <br
  />Hemingway was affectionately known as 'Papa' in Cuba and this drink was originally
  named 'Daiquiri Like Papa' and then later 'Papa Doble'. After Meilan added maraschino
  and grapefruit the drink changed its name again to the Hemingway Special we recognise
  today.<br /><br />
