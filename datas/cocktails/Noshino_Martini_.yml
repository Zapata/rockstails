name: 'Noshino Martini '
method: STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass. <br /><br />
rate: 4.0
garnish: Slice English cucumber<br />
glass: Martini
comment: If good quality sake and shochu are used then this can be a great drink.
  However, it lacks the alcoholic bite I associate with a true Martini, so I much
  prefer this drink when vodka is used in place of shochu.<br /><br /><br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE"
