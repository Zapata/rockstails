aka: 
variant: Chicago, Prince of Wales
origin: First recorded in Jerry Thomas's 1862 book 'How To Mix Drinks', or 'The Bon
  Vivant's Companion', where he almost certainly mistakenly specifies this as a shaken
  drink. That would be explosive. Another early reference to Champagne cocktails is
  in Mark Twain's 1869 novel, Innocents Abroad. It is thought the drink found popularity
  after a bartender named John Dougherty won an 1899 New York cocktail competition
  with a similar drink named Business Brace.<br /><br />
