origin: Created in the late 1990s by Salvatore Calabrese at the Library Bar, London,
  England. It is very similar to the 'Marmalade Cocktail' created in the 1920s by
  Harry Craddock and published in his 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book' or you could
  describe this as being White Lady with marmalade in it.<br />    <br />Salvatore
  came up with the idea for this drink after his wife insisted he have breakfast one
  morning and served up toast and marmalade. He took the jar to work with him and
  this contemporary classic was the result. This drink was the inspiration for the
  many variations on the preserve (jam/marmalade) theme that have followed in the
  decade since Salvatore stopped for 'proper' breakfast rather than just his usual
  swift espresso.<br /><br />
