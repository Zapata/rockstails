rate: 3.5
garnish: Lemon slice &amp; cherry on stick (sail)
glass: Old-fashioned
comment: 'This 4:2:8 formula is a tad sourer than the classic 3:4:8 which translates
  as: three quarter part of the sour ingredient (lemon juice), one part of the sweet
  ingredient (sugar syrup) and two parts of the strong ingredient (spirit). So if
  you find my formula to sour than best follow the classic proportions in future.<br

variant: 
origin: Sours are aptly named drinks. Their flavour comes from either lemon or lime
  juice, which is balanced with sugar. Sours can be based on practically any spirit
  but the bourbon based Whiskey Sour is by far the most popular. Many (including myself)
  believe this drink is only properly made when smoothed with a little egg white.<br
  /><br />Sours are served either straight-up in a Sour glass (rather like a small
  flute) or on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass. They are traditionally garnished
  with a cherry and an orange slice, or sometimes a lemon slice. <br />
