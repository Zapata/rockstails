variant: Hot Grog
origin: For over 300 years the British Navy issued a daily 'tot' of rum, sometimes
  with double issues before battle. In 1740, as an attempt to combat drunkenness,
  Admiral Vernon gave orders that the standard daily issue of half a pint of neat,
  high-proof rum be replaced with two servings of a quarter of a pint, diluted 4:1
  with water. The Admiral was nicknamed 'Old Grogram' due to the waterproof grogram
  cloak he wore, so the mixture he introduced became known as 'grog'. Lime juice was
  often added to the grog in an attempt to prevent scurvy, lending British sailors
  their 'limey' nickname.<br />        <br />The 'tot' tradition, which started in
  Jamaica in 1665, was finally broken on 31st July 1970, a day now known as 'Black
  Tot Day' - although by then the 'tot' had been reduced to a meagre two ounces.<br
  />       <br />Sounds plausible to me but drinks historians now say that grog is
  earlier than Old Grogram.<br /><br />
