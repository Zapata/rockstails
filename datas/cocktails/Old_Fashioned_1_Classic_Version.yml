  As <span ,="" ;="" georgia="" serif="" style="font-size: 10pt;">with the Martini, the glass this cocktail is served

  in has taken the name of the drink. The cocktails creation is credited to a

  bartender called Martin Cuneo at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky.

  USA. He is said to have made the drink for a Kentucky Colonel (and bourbon

  distiller) named James E. Pepper sometime between 1889 and 1895. In those days

  the clubhouse was situated at in the old Belknap family mansion located between

  Third and Fourth Streets on the south side of Walnut Street (now Muhammad Ali

  Blvd.) in Louisville. This was torn down and replaced by the current opulent

  Georgian clubhouse, located about a block to the east, at 218 West Walnut

  Street, which opened in late 1928.<br /><br />A number of sources collaborate the Old

  Fashioned originating the Pendennis Club, including the 1931 book, Old Waldorf

  Bar Days, in which it author, Albert Stevens Crocket, writes of this drink, &quot;This was brought to the Old Waldorf in the days of the 'sit-down' Bar, and was

  introduced by, or in the honor of, Col. James E. Pepper, of Kentucky, a

  proprietor of a celebrated whiskey of the period. It was said to have been the

  invention of a bartender at the famous Pendennis Club in Louisville, of which

  Col. Pepper was a member.&quot;</span><br /><br />
