origin: Adapted from a recipe by Charles H. Baker Junior. In his 1939 'The Gentleman's
  Companion' he writes of this drink, "a Hazy Memory of a Night in Havana during the
  Unpleasantnesses of 1933, when Each Swallow Was Punctuated with Bombs Going off
  on the Prado, or the Sound of 3" Shells Being Fired at the Hotel NACIONAL, then
  Haven for Certain Anti-Revolutionary Officers".<br />        <br />The drink is
  named after the press slogan, which allegedly provoked the 1898 Spanish-American
  War.<br /><br />
