  which was traditionally Italian while French vermouth was dry. In his 'Craft of
  the Cocktail', Dale DeGroff states that this drink was originally known as a 'Sweet
  Martini' and as such was a popular drink during the 1880s and 1890s at the Hoffman
  House and other New York bars. Later it became known as &quot;Gin &amp; Italian&quot;,
  until during/post Prohibition it was shortened to &quot;Gin &amp; It&quot;. <br
