  Comment: Blackcurrant wine - clean, crisp and not too sweet.
  Origin: This drink takes its name from a colourful politician and WWII resistance hero by the name of Canon Felix Kir, who served as the Mayor of Dijon, France, between 1945 and 1965. In order to promote local products, at receptions he served an apertif made with cr√®me de cassis and Bourgogne Aligot white wine. The concoction quickly became known as Canon Kir's apertif, then Father Kir's apertif and finally as the Kir apertif.
