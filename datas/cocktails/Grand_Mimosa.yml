  champagne.
rate: 3.5

origin: The Mimosa was created in 1925 at the Ritz Hotel, Paris, and named after the
  Mimosa plant - probably because of its trembling leaves, rather like the gentle
  fizz of this mixture. The Grand Mimosa as shown here benefits from the addition
  of Grand Marnier liqueur.
