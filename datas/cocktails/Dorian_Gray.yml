origin: Discovered in 1999 at One Aldwych, London, England. This cocktail takes its
  name from Oscar Wilde's novel, in which a socialite's wish to remain as young and
  charming as his own portrait is granted. Allured by his depraved friend Lord Henry
  Wotton, Dorian Gray assumes a life of perversion and sin. But every time he sins
  the painting ages, while Gray stays young and healthy.
