  Comment: Charles was pretty sour about his experience when he created this very aromatic sour.<br /><br />
  Origin: On 16th May 2008, superstar bartender Charles Vexenat was unjustly jailed in New Orleans during Tales of the Cocktail after Dre dropped a bottle in the Old Absinthe House. Fortunately for Charles he was saved a second day in the slammer by Melanie Asher, owner of Macchu Pisco who bailed them out. This cocktail, created at PDT, New York City, is Charles's tribute to Melanie.<br /><br />
