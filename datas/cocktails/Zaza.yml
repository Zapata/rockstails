  AKA: Dubbonet Cocktail
  Comment: Zaza is a diminutive of Isabelle. But there's nothing diminutive about this simple, yet fantastic drink.
  Origin: I've adapted this from a recipe in Harry Craddock's 1930 'Savoy Cocktail Book'. It is named after a French play which was a hit around the verge of the 20th century and was followed by opera and film versions.
  Variant: Substitute Sloe gin or Fino sherry in place of gin.
