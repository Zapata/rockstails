rate: 4.0

comment: Zaza is a diminutive of Isabelle. But there's nothing diminutive about this
  simple, yet fantastic drink.
aka: Dubbonet Cocktail
variant: Substitute Sloe gin or Fino sherry in place of gin.
origin: I've adapted this from a recipe in Harry Craddock's 1930 'Savoy Cocktail Book'.
  It is named after a French play which was a hit around the verge of the 20th century
  and was followed by opera and film versions.
