name: Blue Blazer
method: WARNING - do not attempt to make this drink. If you really must, then please
  practice with water first to perfect your method, stand on a non-flammable floor,
  have suitable fire fighting equipment and preferably a medical professional nearby.
  You will need two large silver-plated mugs with handles. Preheat the mugs with boiling
  water and warm the whisky. POUR the whisky into one mug and fresh boiling water
  into the other. Ignite the whiskey using a long match and while still blazing pour
  the whisky into the other mug. Then mix ingredients by pouring them from one mug
  to the other. The foolhardy increase the distance between the mugs as they pour,
  thus creating a spectacular long blue flame between the two mugs. Extinguish flame
  by covering mug, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powered sugar.<br
