name: Liquorice Whisky Sour
method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass.
rate: 4.5
garnish: Dust with grated liquorice
glass: Old-fashioned
comment: Liquorice (or licorice for our American readers) dramatically changes the
  classic Sour, working harmoniously with the Scotch. I have also tried with bourbon
  and the result is not nearly so pleasing. <br /><br />
