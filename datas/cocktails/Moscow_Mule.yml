origin: This classic combination was born in 1941. John G. Martin had acquired the
  rights to Smirnoff vodka for Heublein, a small Connecticut based liquor and food
  distributor. Jack Morgan, the owner of Hollywood's famous Cock'n'Bull Saloon, was
  trying to launch his own brand of ginger beer. The two men met at New York City's
  Chatham Bar and hit on the idea of mixing Martin's vodka with Morgan's ginger beer
  and adding a dash of lime to create a new cocktail, the Moscow Mule.<br />       <br
  />To help promote the drink, and hence their respective products, Morgan had the
  idea of marketing the Moscow Mule using specially engraved mugs. The five ounce
  mugs were embossed with a kicking mule and made at a copper factory a friend of
  his had recently inherited. The promotion helped turn Smirnoff into a major brand.<br
