origin: Pronounced 'spal-yacht-oh' which in Italian means 'mistake', this drink was
  created in the late 1980s by Mirko Stocchetti at his Bar Basso in Milan when making
  a Negroni he mistakenly reached for a bottle of spumante instead of gin. They are
  still served at Basso today in enormous chalice like glasses with single, giant,
  rectangular ice cube.<br />
