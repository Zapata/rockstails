origin: Michael Romanoff (1890-1971) was a Hollywood impresario. Born Hershel Geguzin
  in Lithuania he immigrated to New York City aged ten and changed his name to Harry
  F. Gerguson. He moved to Hollywood where he took on the Michael Romanoff persona,
  claiming to be born Prince Michael Alexandrovitch Dimitri Obolensky Romanoff, nephew
  of Tsar Nicholas II. Scotland Yard described the former British and French convict
  as a "rouge of uncertain nationality." He was another actor in a town of actors
  and when a filmmaker needed a 'technical adviser' for a movie set in Europe, Romanoff
  was the obvious well paid expert. He was a popular Hollywood figure and he opened
  Romanoff's, a Beverly Hills restaurant popular with movie stars in the 1940s and
  1950s.<br />       <br />Humphrey Bogart was a good friend of Romanoff and a regular
  at the restaurant. Hollywood legend has it that one day in 1955 Bogie was lunching
  with Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Jimmy Van Heusen when Mrs Bogart, A.K.A. Lauren
  Bacall walked into the restaurant and on seeing the group exclaimed, &quot;I see
  the rat pack is all here&quot;. Thus Romanoff's became the place where the Rat Pack
  term was first coined and also where this drink was created.<br />       <br />David
  Niven was also a close friend and in his book 'Bring on the Empty Horses' he devotes
  chapter eight, 'The Emperor', to the colourful Romanoff.<br /><br />
