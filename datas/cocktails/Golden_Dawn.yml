name: Golden Dawn
method: SHAKE first 5 ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass. Carefully
  POUR grenadine into centre of drink so that it sinks to create a sunrise effect.
rate: 4.0
garnish: Orange zest twist
glass: Martini
comment: Although it spoils the sunrise effect, this drink is less tart if the syrup
  lying on the bottom is stirred into the drink (or, better, included when shaking).

variant: 
origin: Created in September 1930 by Tom Buttery at the Berkeley Hotel, London, England.
  There are now many versions of this classic drink (David Embury's 'The Fine Art
  of Mixing Drinks' lists three) but this is my favourite.
