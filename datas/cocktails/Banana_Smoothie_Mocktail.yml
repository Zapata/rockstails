name: Banana Smoothie (Mocktail)
method: BLEND ingredients with 12oz scoop of crushed ice. Pour into glass and serve
  immediately with straws.
rate: 4.5
garnish: Banana chunk on rim
glass: Hurricane
comment: Serve with breakfast cereal and you'll be set up for the day. The high fresh
  banana content means this drink will quickly turn brown if left. This can be countered
  by adding fresh lemon juice and balancing with more honey but this detracts from
  the fresh banana flavour.
