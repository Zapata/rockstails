origin: Created in the early 1900s by Ada 'Coley' Coleman at The Savoy's American
  Bar, London, for actor Sir Charles Hawtrey. He often said to Coley, "I am tired.
  Give me something with a bit of punch in it." This drink was her answer. After finishing
  his first one, Charles told Coley, "By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!" And
  so it has since been named. Coley was the first Bar Manger of the famous American
  Bar. She perfected her craft at Claridge's and left to start at the Savoy in July
  1903, where she stayed until her retirement in December 1924. The Hanky-Panky is
  her most famous creation.<br /><br />
