origin: <p>Legend has it that the drink was created by Harry MacElhone at his Harry's
  American Bar, Paris, in 1925 and was named after the 75mm Howitzer field gun used
  by the French army during the First World War (1914 to 1918). However, like other
  drinks in the first (1919) edition of Harry's own book, 'The ABC of Mixing Drinks',
  he credits the drink to Macgarry of Buck's Club, London, England.<br /></p><p>However,
  its creation is now commonly attributed to the USA during the Prohibition era (1920-1933).
  Although the Howitzer was mounted on American tanks my issues with the American
  origin theory are that the Great War was well over by the time Prohibition started
  and I question whether an American, now or then, would name a drink after a metric
  measurement. Being a Brit, I favour The French 75 being an English drink that gained
  in popularity in France during the Prohibition era and found its way to the US with
  returning officers.</p><br />
