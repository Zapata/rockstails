origin: This recipe is adapted from one by Del Pedro, Alexander's, New York City.
  It came to me (in 1997) courtesy of the infamous LeNell Smothers. To quote from
  Del, "I used to call this a 'Gatsby cooler' at one time, because there seems something
  kinda evilly 'Hampton-ish' about this drink... but I also called it 'He's At Home'
  which was the name given to porcelain dildos that Nantucket ship's captain's wives
  kept stashed in the flue of their fireplaces for the lonely winter nights when the
  old dog was chasing whales."<br /><br />
