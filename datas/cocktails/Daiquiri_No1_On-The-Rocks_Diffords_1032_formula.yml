  Comment: Light and refreshing. No one flavour predominates - sweet and sour are in harmony with the rum.<br /><br />
  Origin: "In my formative Daiquiri drinking years I followed the convention that a Daiquiri No.1 should be served 'straight-up'. However, I have now reverted to drinking my Daiquiris 'on-the-rocks' and interestingly Cox's original recipe (see Daiquiri No.1 Natural) suggests that this may also be the way he originally intended the drink to be served. In his diary Cox stipulates, \"Put all ingredients in a cocktail shaker and shake well. Do not strain as the glass may be served with some ice.\" And as Albert S. Crockett notes of this drink in his 1935 'The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book', \"Personal preference dictates serving the cocktail with finely shaved ice in the glass.\"<br />        <br />Obviously serving a drink over ice will add dilution so rendering the additional dash of water to my 10:3:2 Daiquiri formula superfluous. Having tried 'up' and 'on-the-rocks' Daiquiris made to the same 'No.1' formula next to each other I have to admit that more nuances are found in the 'up' when compared to 'on-the-rocks'. However, I prefer holding and drinking from a big heavy old-fashioned glass rather than a V-shaped Martini or curvaceous Coupette. Thus I now vary my serve according to mood but with 1/2 shot of water added when served 'up' and omitted when served 'on-the-rocks'.<br /> "
