  Comment: A cooling, combination of five different spirits with a hint of lime and a splash of cola.<br /><br />
  Origin: This infamous drink reached the height of its popularity in the early 1980s of the many stories surrounding its origin, perhaps the most credible attributes its creation to sometime in the late 1970s by Robert (Rosebud) Butt at Oak Beach Inn in Babylon, New York. This area of New York State is known as 'Long Island' and the drink looks like iced tea disguising its contents - a fact that has many claiming its true origins lie with Prohibition.<br /><br />
