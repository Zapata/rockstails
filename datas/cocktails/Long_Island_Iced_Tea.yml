origin: This infamous drink reached the height of its popularity in the early 1980s
  of the many stories surrounding its origin, perhaps the most credible attributes
  its creation to sometime in the late 1970s by Robert (Rosebud) Butt at Oak Beach
  Inn in Babylon, New York. This area of New York State is known as 'Long Island'
  and the drink looks like iced tea disguising its contents - a fact that has many
  claiming its true origins lie with Prohibition.<br /><br />
