  a small jug (known in France as a 'broc') so the customer can dilute to their own

origin: Pronounced 'Mor-Esk', this classic drink is very popular in the South of France,
  where it is now commonly made with pastis in place of absinthe. It was originally
  created by French soldiers serving in the Bataillon d'Afrique during the Algerian
  campaign of the 1830s and 40s, and was alternatively known as Bureau Arabe after
  the military department which dealt with local affairs and was said to act like
  "an iron fist in a velvet glove".
