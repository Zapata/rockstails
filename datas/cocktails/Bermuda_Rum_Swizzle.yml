origin: This recipe is adapted from one by Del Pedro, originally from Bermuda but
  now resident in New York City. It came my way (in 1997) courtesy of the dangerously
  sexy LeNell Smothers, and apparently it originally heralds from the Swizzle Inn
  in Bermuda where their rather appropriate slogan is &quot;Swizzle Inn, Swagger Out&quot;.<br
