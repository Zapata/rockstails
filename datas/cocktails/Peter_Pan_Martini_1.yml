rate: 3.0
garnish: Orange zest twist

aka: 
variant: Substitute Angostura aromatic bitters for peach bitters.
origin: Adapted from a recipe in the 1930 edition of the Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry
  Craddock. The original recipe called for equal parts, including the<br />bitters
  - surely a mistake.
