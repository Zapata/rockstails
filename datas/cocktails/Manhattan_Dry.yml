origin: Like so many cocktails, the origins of the Manhattan are lost in time. And,
  as neither the name nor the ingredients are so unusual as to prevent inadvertent
  duplication, the mystery is likely to remain unsolved. The Democrat newspaper remarked
  in 1882 that, 'It is but a short time ago that a mixture of whiskey, vermouth and
  bitters came into vogue' and observed that it had been known as a Turf Club cocktail,
  a Jockey Club cocktail and a Manhattan cocktail.<br />       <br />Until fairly
  recently, the most popular story was that the drink was created in November 1874
  at New York City's Manhattan Club for Lady Randolph Churchill (ne Jenny Jerome),
  while she was celebrating the successful gubernatorial campaign of Samuel Jones
  Tilden. (The Manhattan Club was opposite the site which now houses the Empire State
  Building.) However, David Wondrich has pointed out that the banquet in question
  was held in November 1874, when Lady C was otherwise engaged, in England, giving
  birth to Winston.<br />    <br />A 1945 article claims that a drink under the name
  of the Manhattan appeared in an 1860 bar guide; it certainly appears in Harry Johnson's
  book of 1884.<br />    <br />A plausible story comes from a book published in 1923,
  'Valentine's Manual of New York'. In this a William F. Mulhall who was a bartender
  at New York's Hoffman House in the 1880s recounts, &quot;The Manhattan cocktail
  was invented by a man named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street
  on Broadway in the [eighteen] sixties - probably the most famous drink in the world
  in its time.&quot;<br />    <br />Yet another story involves a Col. Joe Walker on
  a yachting trip in New York but as this specifically refers to sweet vermouth I
  have recounted it under 'Manhattan Sweet'. <br /><br />
