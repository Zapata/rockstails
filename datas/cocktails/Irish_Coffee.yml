aka: Gaelic Coffee
variant: Sweeten with sugar syrup or liqueur to taste before floating cream.
origin: This now ubiquitous cocktail was created in 1942 by Joe Sheridan, a bartender
  at Foynes airport (near the present-day Shannon airport). The majority of transatlantic
  flights used to stop to refuel in Ireland and in 1947 an American journalist, Stan
  Delaphane, found himself at Joe Sheridan's bar and tried his Irish Coffee. Delaphane
  was so impressed that on returning home he passed the recipe on to the bartender
  at his local bar, the Buena Vista Caf in San Francisco. The recipe spread and the
  drink became a classic.<br /><br />
