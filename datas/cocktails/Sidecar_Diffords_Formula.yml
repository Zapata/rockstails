name: Sidecar (Difford's Formula)
method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass.
rate: 4.5
garnish: Lemon zest twist
glass: Martini
comment: Complex and very slightly on the sour side of balanced. Those with a sweet
  tooth may prefer with a sugar rim.<br /><br />There have been periods when it has
  been fashionable to coat the rim of the glass in which this drink is to be served
  with sugar. Thankfully sugar rims are now out of vogue and, as Embury writes in
  his book, "A twist of lemon may be used if desired and the peel dropped into the
  glass. Otherwise no decoration."<br /><br />
aka: 
variant: Apple Cart
origin: 'In his 1948 ''Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'', David A. Embury writes of the
  Sidecar: "It was invented by a friend of mine at a bar in Paris during World War
  I and was named after the motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain customarily
  was driven to and from the little bistro where the drink was born and christened."<br
  />        <br />Embury doesn''t name the bar but it''s commonly assumed that he
  meant Harry''s New York Bar and that the cocktail was created by its owner, Harry
  MacElhone. However, in Harry''s own book he credits the drink to Pat MacGarry of
  Buck''s Club, London.<br />        <br />The proportions of this drink are debated
  as much as its origin. Perhaps due to ease rather than balance, the equal parts
  formula (1 x brandy, 1 x triple sec and 1 x lemon juice) was the earliest published
  recipe (Robert Vermeire''s 1922 ''Cocktails: How to Mix Them'' and Harry McElhone''s
  1922 ''ABC of mixing cocktails'') and still seems popular to this day.<br />        <br
  />Embury writes of the ''equal parts'' Sidecar, "This is the most perfect example
  of a magnificent drink gone wrong". He argues that "Essentially the Sidecar is nothing
  but a Daiquiri with brandy in the place of rum and Cointreau in the place of sugar
  syrup" and so the Daiquiri formula should be followed (2 x brandy, 1/2 x triple
  sec and 1/4 lemon juice). This may work for a Daiquiri but makes for an overly dry
  Sidecar.<br />        <br />In his 1930 ''The Savoy Cocktail Book'', Harry Craddock
  calls for 2 x brandy; 1 x Cointreau and 1 x lemon juice. The formula I use here
  takes the middle ground between The Savoy and the ''equal parts'' camp. I also find
  this drink benefits from a little extra dilution.<br /><br /><br /><br />'
