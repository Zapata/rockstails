name: 'Absinthe Drip Cocktail #2 (Czech method)'
method: PLACE sugar cube on a slotted absinthe spoon resting across the top of the
  glass. POUR the absinthe over the sugar cube into the glass. LIGHT the absinthe
  soaked cube and leave to burn and caramelise. Using a bottle of chilled mineral
  water with a small hole in the cap, DRIP water over what's left of the sugar so
  it dissolves and drips into the glass. Add ice, stir and serve.
rate: 3.0
garnish: 
glass: Absinthe glass or old-fashioned
comment: More about the theatrics involved in its making than the taste of the finished
  drink.
aka: 
variant: 
origin: This supposedly bohemian method of serving absinthe came back in to being
  in 1998 with the UK launch of Hill's Absinth.
