origin: The Irish tricolour is the national flag of the Republic of Ireland. Its three
  equal stripes represent the political landscape. Orange stands for the Protestants
  because of William of Orange, the Protestant king of England who defeated the Roam
  Catholic James II in 1690. Green stands for the Catholic nationalists of the south
  and white for the the hope of peace between Catholics and Protestants.
