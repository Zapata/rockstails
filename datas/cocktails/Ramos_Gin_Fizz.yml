origin: This was the secret recipe of Henry C. Ramos, who opened his Imperial Cabinet
  Bar in New Orleans in 1888. At the onset of Prohibition his brother, Charles Henry
  Ramos, published it in a full-page advertisement, and since 1935, the Roosevelt
  (now named the Fairmont) Hotel, New Orleans, has held the trademark on the name
  Ramos Gin Fizz.<br />    <br />To make a more traditional style of Ramos Gin Fizz
  try using full fat milk in place of cream and shake until bubbles disappear.<br
