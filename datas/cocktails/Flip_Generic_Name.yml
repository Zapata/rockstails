  Comment: I favour creamy, spicy, bourbon based Flips.
  Origin: Flips basically consist of any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole egg and sweetened with sugar. They can also contain cream and are typically garnished with a dusting of nutmeg and served in a sour glass or small Martini glass. They can be served hot or cold.<br />        <br />The very first Flips, which emerged as early as the late 1600s, consisted of tankard of ale to which a mixture made from sugar, eggs and spices was added before being heated with a red-hot iron poker from the fire. Later they came to mean any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole egg and sweetened with sugar.<br /><br />
  Variant: Served hot in a toddy glass - heat in a microwave oven or mix in a pan over heat.
