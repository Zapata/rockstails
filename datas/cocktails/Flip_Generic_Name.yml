origin: Flips basically consist of any fortified wine or liquor shaken with a whole
  egg and sweetened with sugar. They can also contain cream and are typically garnished
  with a dusting of nutmeg and served in a sour glass or small Martini glass. They
  can be served hot or cold.<br />        <br />The very first Flips, which emerged
  as early as the late 1600s, consisted of tankard of ale to which a mixture made
  from sugar, eggs and spices was added before being heated with a red-hot iron poker
  from the fire. Later they came to mean any fortified wine or liquor shaken with
  a whole egg and sweetened with sugar.<br /><br />
