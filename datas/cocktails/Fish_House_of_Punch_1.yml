origin: Probably the most famous of all punch recipes, this originated in 1732 at
  a Philadelphia fishing and social club called the 'State in Schuylkill'. As a punch
  the original was mixed in larger quantities and served from a punch bowl. <br />Many
  modern variations use soda water (club soda) in place of mineral water. The inclusion
  of peach liqueur is a modern substitute for the traditional peach brandy. However,
  it's believed the Schuylkill original omitted peach entirely.<br /><br />
