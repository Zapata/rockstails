name: Fizz (Generic Name)
method: SHAKE first four ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass (no ice
  in glass). TOP with soda dispensed from a siphon.<br /><br />

comment: I recommend the Derby Fizz with its combination of liqueur and spirits over
  these more traditional versions.<br /><br />

variant: 
origin: 'Like the Collins, this mid-19th century classic is basically a sour lengthened
  with charged water and at first glance there is little difference between a Fizz
  and a Collins. However, there are several distinguishing features. A Collins should
  be served in at least a twelve ounce, and ideally a fourteen ounce tall glass, while
  that used for a Fizz should be no bigger than eight ounces. A Collins should be
  served in an ice-filled glass, while a Fizz should be served in a chilled glass
  without ice.<br />        <br />A Fizz should also be made using charged water from
  a siphon in preference to soda from bottles or cans. The burst of pressure from
  the siphon bulb generates tiny bubbles which give off carbonic acid, benefiting
  the flavour and the mouth-feel of the drink.<br />        <br />For the correct
  proportions I have turned to David A. Embury''s seminal ''The Fine Art of Mixing
  Drinks''. He recommends "1 - or a little less - sweet (sugar, fruit syrup, or liqueur),
  2 sour (lime or lemon juice), 3 - or a little more - strong (spirituous liquor),
  and 4 weak (charged water and ice). I interpret this as follows: 2 shots spirit
  (gin, whiskey, vodka, brandy), 1 shot lemon or lime juice,  1/2  shot sugar syrup,
  topped up with soda. I also like to add half a fresh egg white, which technically
  makes the drink a ''Silver Fizz''.<br /><br />'
