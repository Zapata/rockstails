name: Abacaxi Ricaco
method: Cut the top off a small pineapple and carefully scoop out the flesh from the
  base to leave a shell with 12mm (1/2 inch) thick walls. Place the shell in a freezer
  to chill. Remove the hard core from the pineapple flesh and discard; roughly chop
  the remaining flesh, add other ingredients and BLEND with one 12oz scoop of crushed
  ice. Pour into the pineapple shell and serve with straws. (The flesh of one pineapple
  blended with the following ingredients will fill at least two shells).
rate: 4.0
garnish: Cut a straw sized hole in the top of the pineapple shell and replace it as
  a lid.
glass: Pineapple shell (frozen)
comment: Looks and tastes great but a load of hassle to make.
