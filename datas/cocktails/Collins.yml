comment: Some say the John/Tom Collins was originally made with genever. So is this
  the original or an adaption on the Tom Collins. We will probably never know but
  whatever, it tastes great.<br /><br />

variant: 
origin: In England, this drink is traditionally credited to John Collins, a bartender
  who worked at Limmer's Hotel, Conduit Street, London. The 'coffee house' of this
  hotel, a true dive bar, was popular with sporting types during the 19th century,
  and famous, according to the 1860s memoirs of a Captain Gronow, for its gin-punch
  as early as 1814.<br /><br />Others say that the Tom Collins originated in New York,
  and takes its name from the Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874, a practical joke which
  involved telling a friend that a man named Tom Collins had been insulting them,
  and that he could be found in a bar some distance away, and took the city by storm.
  This is supported by the fact that the first known written occurrence of a Tom Collins
  cocktail recipe is found in the 1876 edition of Jerry Thomas' 'The Bartender's Guide'.<br
  />    <br />An alternative story attributes the drink to a Collins who started work
  at a New York tavern called the Whitehouse in 1873 and started pouring a thirst
  quencher made with gin. Another identifies a different Tom Collins, who worked as
  a bartender in New Jersey and New York area. There are apparently also versions
  of its creation in San Francisco and Australia, and it is not impossible that the
  drink evolved in two or more places independently.<br />       <br />There is also
  debate as to whether Old Tom gin, London Dry gin or Dutch genever was the original
  spirit base. Other spirits have since spawned an entire family of Collins' variants
  as follows:<br /><br />Captain Collins (with Canadian whiskey)<br />Colonel Collins
  (with Bourbon)<br />Jack Collins (with vodka)<br />Jock or Sandy Collins (with Scotch
  whisky)<br />Joe Collins (with vodka)<br />John Collins (with London dry gin)<br
  />Mike Collins (with Irish whiskey)<br />Pedro Collins (with light white rum)<br
  />Pepito Collins (with tequila)<br />Pierre Collins (with cognac/brandy)<br />Tom
  Collins (with old tom gin)<br />Vodka Collins (AKA Joe Collins)<br /><br />
