comment: Remembering that Hemingway was a diabetic so has a very sour tooth, I believe
  this drink needs more than "one teaspoon" of sugar. Thus I have added half a shot
  of syrup to the original recipe. It also needs dilution, so be sure to shake well
  and churn in the glass.<br /><br />

origin: According to 'Gentleman's Companion' this libation was a favourite of Ernest
  Hemingway. "... we got Hemingway's other picker-upper, and liked it. Take a tall
  thin water tumbler and fill it with finely cracked ice. Lace this broken debris
  with four good purple splashes of Angostura, add the juice and crushed peel of one
  green lime, and fill the glass almost full with Holland gin . . . No sugar, no fancying.
  It's strong, it's bitter  - but so is English ale strong and bitter, in many cases.
  We don't add sugar to ale, and we don't need sugar in a Death In The Gulf Stream
  - or at least not more than one teaspoon. Its tartness and its bitterness are its
  chief charm. It is reviving and refreshing; cools the blood and inspires renewed
  interest in food, companions and life."<br /><br />
