  Comment: Earthy taste with freshness coming fro the grapefruit.<br /><br />
  Origin: Created in 2008 by Willy Shine at Contemporary Cocktails Inc. in New York City. The name is a reference to NYC's 212 area code as well as the ounces in the recipe. Will is also the Partida Tequila Ambassador for NYC so I should point out that this is the brand originally called for in his recipe.<br /><br />
