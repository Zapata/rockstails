method: Pour all ingredients into ice-filled glass<br />
rate: 4.5
garnish: Orange slice
glass: Collins
comment: Like the Screwdriver, the HArvey Wallbanger has sadly waned in popularity
  in recent years, probably due to it being served with packaged orange juice. When
  made with freshly squeezed orange juice and recently revived Galliano L'Autentico
  this is worthy of a renaissance.<br />

  Legend has it that 'Harvey' was a surfer at Manhattan beach, California. His favourite drink was a Screwdriver with added Galliano. One day in the late sixties, while celebrating winning a surfing competition, he staggered from bar to bar, banging his surfboard on the walls, and so a contemporary classic gained its name.

  <br /><br />However, an article in Bartender Magazine credits the creation to Bill Donner, the host of a house party held in the mid-sixties in Newport Beach, California. One of the guests, Harvey, was found banging his head the next morning, complaining of the hangover this drink induced.
