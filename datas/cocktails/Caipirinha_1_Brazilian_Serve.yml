variant: 
origin: Pronounced 'Kie-Pur-Reen-Yah', the name of this traditional Brazilian cocktail
  literally translates as 'little countryside drink'. It is made by muddling green
  lemons known as 'limon subtil', which are native to Brazil (limes are the best substitute
  when these are not available), and mixing with sugar and cachaca. Be sure to muddle
  in a sturdy, non-breakable glass.     <br /><br />In Britain and other 'new' cachaca
  markets it is common practice to serve this drink with crushed ice but in Brazil
  it is usually served with cubed ice. Capirinhas and variations on the theme are
  staples in cachacerias, traditional Brazilian bars which specialise in cachaca.<br
