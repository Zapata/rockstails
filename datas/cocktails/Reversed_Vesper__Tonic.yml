rate: 5.0
garnish: Lemon zest twist

comment: Martini in style but with the hard edges shaken off and a hint of eastern
  spice added. Scarily, it took 14 attempts and 13 wasted drinks to arrive at the
  above formula. <br /><br />

variant: 
origin: Created in 2008 by Yours Truly (Simon Difford) at the Cabinet Room, London,
  England. James Bond named his favourite style of Martini after the beautiful Russian
  agent Vesper Lynd. This version is 'Reversed' due to the dramatically increased
  ratio of Lillet. It mixes east and west ingredients with the introduction of Becherovka,
  and where there is Becherovka there should be tonic water.<br /><br />
