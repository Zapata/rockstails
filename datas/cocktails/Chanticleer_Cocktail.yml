origin: Recipe adapted from A.S. Crockett's 1935, The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book
  which originally calls for 'orange gin' rather than using an orange liqueur. Crockett
  handily says of this drink, &quot;Add a Cock's Comb if desired.&quot; He     also
  explains that the drink &quot;Celebrated the local opening of Edmond Rostand's     Chanticler&quot;.
  Edmond Rostand was a French poet and dramatist, best-known for his     play Cyrano
  de Bergerac. First released in 1910, Chantecler (correct spelling)     is a story
  where the characters are based on barnyard animals, and whose     eponymous protagonist
  is a rooster who believes that his song makes the sun     rise.<br />By all accounts
  the cocktail is     rather better than the play. Incidentally, the 'Chantecler'
  is actually a breed     of chicken developed in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century
  by Brother Wilfred     Chantelain, a Trappist monk at the Abbey of Notre-Dame du
  Lac in Oka Canada
