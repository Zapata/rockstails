variant: 
origin: Recipe adapted from David A. Embury's 1953 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', in
  which he writes of this drink, &quot;Peychaud, somehow seems to blend better than
  Angostura with the Scotch.&quot; &quot;Benedictine is sometimes used in place of
  Drambuie. However, the Drambuie is preferable because it is made with a Scotch whisky
  base.&quot;<br />
