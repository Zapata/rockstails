  Comment: It's common to pair Scotch and Zubrwka with apple, but combining all three together with wine and honey really works.
  Origin: Created in 2002 by yours truly and named after the rhyming slang for 'are you bloody sure?'  Bobby Moore was the 60s England football captain and West Ham United defender who regrettably died young in 1993. My dictionary of rhyming slang claims 'Bobby Moore' means 'door' - well, not in East London it doesn't.
