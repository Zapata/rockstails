origin: Created in 2002 by yours truly and named after the rhyming slang for 'are
  you bloody sure?'  Bobby Moore was the 60s England football captain and West Ham
  United defender who regrettably died young in 1993. My dictionary of rhyming slang
  claims 'Bobby Moore' means 'door' - well, not in East London it doesn't.
