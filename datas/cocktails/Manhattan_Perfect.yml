aka: 
variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Sweet. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned
  glass.<br /><br />
origin: Whatever the truth of its invention (see Manhattan Dry), the Manhattan was
  probably originally made with rye whiskey, rather than bourbon, as New York was
  a rye-drinking city, although early bar books just state 'whiskey'. Today it is
  common to use bourbon, although purists are beginning to revive rye.<br />       <br
  />When Scotch is substituted for bourbon the Manhattan becomes a Rob Roy, with brandy
  (cognac) it becomes a Harvard and with applejack it is a Star Cocktail when made
  with applejack.<br />    <br />Some time in 2005 it became conventional in some
  New York bars to garnish a Manhattan with two cherries as a 9/11 tribute.<br /><br
