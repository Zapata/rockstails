aka: 
variant: 
origin: It has long been traditional in Italy to marinade fresh peaches in wine and
  the Bellini draws on this tradition, combining prosecco wine with pured white peaches.
  <br /><br />Giuseppe Cipriani created this drink at Harry's Bar, Venice, in 1945,
  fourteen years after he opened his tiny place on the edge of the Grand Canal, not
  far from St. Mark's Square. Cipriani named his cocktail after the 15th-century Venetian
  painter Giovanni Bellini due to the drink's pink hue and the painter's penchant
  for using rich pinks on his canvases.<br /><br />Like many other legendary bars
  around the world, Harry's owes some of its notoriety to being patronised by probably
  the world's greatest drinker, Ernest Hemingway. It was also the haunt of Sinclair
  Lewis, Orson Welles, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Dorothy Parker, and continues to attract
  celebrities to this day. But you don't have to be a celebrity to go to Harry's Bar.
  Cocktail aficionados from around the world make pilgrimages to the birthplace of
  the Bellini to sample the original recipe.<br /><br />White peaches are in season
  in Italy from May to September, so in Venice those bars that insist on only using
  fresh peaches rather than frozen puree sell the drink between May and October.<br
