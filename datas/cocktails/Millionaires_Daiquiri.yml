origin: This heralds from a classic cocktail known simply as the Millionaire. Originally
  Sloe gin was the main base ingredient, but David Embury once wrote, &quot;Since
  the sloe gin, which is a liqueur, predominates in this drink, I do not regard it
  as a true cocktail.&quot; Thus above is my modern adaptation.
