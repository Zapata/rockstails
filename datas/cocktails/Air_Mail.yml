    This 
    old classic is basically a Honeysuckle served long and topped with champagne.
    Rum, honey and a touch of citrus freshness make this one of the better
    champagne cocktails.
  Origin: |-
    Adapted from a classic recipe,
    which first appears in the 1949 Esquire's Handbook for Hosts. This is a
    potent drink and the name could be a reference to airmail being the quickest
    way of getting a letter from A to B.
