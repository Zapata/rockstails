comment: "This \n\nold classic is basically a Honeysuckle served long and topped with
  champagne.\n\nRum, honey and a touch of citrus freshness make this one of the better\n\nchampagne
  cocktails."

  Adapted from a classic recipe,

  which first appears in the 1949 Esquire's Handbook for Hosts. This is a
