name: 'Caipirinha #2 (Contemporary Serve)'
method: MUDDLE lime wedges in the base of shaker to release juice and oils in its
  skin. Add cachaca and sugar. SHAKE with 6oz scoop crushed ice and pour all without
  straining into glass.<br /><br />
rate: 4.0
garnish: Serve with 2 short straws
glass: Old-fashioned
comment: There is much debate among bartenders as to whether granulated sugar or sugar
  syrup and if brown or white sugar should be used when making this drink. Those who
  favour granulated sugar argue that muddling with the abrasive crystals helps extract
  the oils from the lime's skin. Personally, I hate the crunch of sugar as inevitably
  not all the granulated sugar dissolves. Whether you should use brown or white sugar
  to make your syrup is another question. I prefer mine made the way it is in its
  native Brazil, with white sugar.<br /><br />

variant: <br />
origin: In its native Brazil it is usual to serve this drink with cubed ice but the
  drink travelled to the UK at a time when the use of crushed ice was fashionable
  and so in this and other 'new' cachaca markets use of crushed ice has become the
  norm. <br /><br />
