origin: Cobblers emerged in the mid 1800s and circa 1880 the bartender Harry Johnson
  said of the Sherry Cobbler "This drink is without doubt the most popular beverage
  in this country, with ladies as well as with gentlemen. It is a very refreshing
  drink for old and young."<br />   <br />Cobblers are served with straws in a goblet
  filled with crushed ice and decorated with fruit and a sprig or two of mint. They
  are based on spirits and/or wine sweetened with sugar syrup or sweet liqueur. Classically
  Cobblers contain little or no citrus but modern variations often call for citrus
  and other fruits to be muddled. Personally I believe it's the lack of citrus that
  sets Cobblers apart. The best examples of these use the tannin and acidity in the
  wine to bitter and so balance.<br /><br />Cobblers are also classically built in
  the glass. I prefer to shake mine to properly cool and mix them before straining
  over fresh crushed ice and stirring. I've taken to calling neo-Martinis which use
  wine in place of citrus 'Cobbled Martinis' (see Cobbled Raspberry Martini) although
  I understand that the name actually refers to the ice and not the fruit.<br /><br
  />Interestingly, this drink is often cited for heralding in the paper straw which
  wasn't patented until 1888. Prior to that straws were just that, 'straw', usually
  rye, or even hollow pasta (macaroni or vermicelli).<br /><br />My version of an
  old classic.<br /><br />
