origin: Today a Gibson is a Dry Martini served with two onions. Charles Dana Gibson
  produced hugely popular pen-and-ink drawings between the 1890s and 1930s. His illustrations
  of girls were as iconic as modern-day supermodels, and it is said this drink was
  named after the well-endowed Gibson Girls - hence the two onions.<br />        <br
  />However, a cocktail book published in 1917 includes a Martini-like drink named
  Gibson but without the onions, and a separate Onion cocktail which we might today
  call a Gibson. Gibson was a member of New York's The Players' club and a bartender
  there by the name of Charley Connolly is credited for at least adding the garnish,
  if not actually creating the drink.<br /><br />
