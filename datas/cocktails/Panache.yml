name: Panache
method: POUR first 2 ingredients into glass. Serve iced water separately in a small
  jug (known in France as a 'broc') so the customer can dilute to their own taste
  (I recommend four-and-a-half shots). Lastly, add ice to glass.
rate: 3.0
garnish: 
glass: Collins
comment: Anisette sweetens the absinthe and adds a refreshing burst of herbal aniseed.

variant: 
origin: This is one of the earliest known absinthe mixtures. Today if you order a
  'panache' at a French caf, you will receive beer with lemonade (shandy).
