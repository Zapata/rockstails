  new=\"\" roman=\"\"  times=\"\">This\r\nvintage cocktail originated from a layered
  or 'pousse-caf' style drink called\r\na Bijou. This original drink was so named
  after the French word meaning 'jewel'\r\ndue to its trio of ingredients being coloured
  after the three most precious\r\njewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and
  emerald (Green Chartreuse).\r\nShaken rather than layered and the colours combine
  to make this aptly named\r\namber coloured drink.</span>"
