    vintage cocktail originated from a layered or 'pousse-caf' style drink called\r\n\
    a Bijou. This original drink was so named after the French word meaning 'jewel'\r\n\
    due to its trio of ingredients being coloured after the three most precious\r\n\
    jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and emerald (Green Chartreuse).\r\n\
    Shaken rather than layered and the colours combine to make this aptly named\r\n\
    amber coloured drink.</span>"
