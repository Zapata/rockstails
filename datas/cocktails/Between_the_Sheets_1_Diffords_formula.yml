garnish: Lemon zest twist
glass: Martini
comment: 'Classic proportions to this drink are most often quoted as being: 1 rum,
  1 cognac, 1 triple sec and 1/4 lemon juice but three shots of 40% alcohol and a
  splash of lemon juice make for a tart drink which should not be undertaken lightly.
  The formula above maintains the essential flavour and ingredients of the classic
  recipe but is a little more approachable.'
