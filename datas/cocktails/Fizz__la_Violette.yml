comment: '<p>Note: The so called ''dry shake'' allows the cream and egg white to emulsify
  thus giving this drink its legendary silky mouth feel without the over dilution
  which would result from such a prolonged shake with ice.</p><br /><p>A delicate
  floral drink that is so creamy smooth that it is almost fluffy.</p><br />'
aka: 
variant: <p>Blend rather than shake.</p>
origin: <p>An adaptation of the Ramos Fizz. In his 1939 'the gentleman's Companion',
  Charles H. Baker Jr. credits this drinks creation to Ahmed Soliman a manufacturer
  and seller of Perfume Essences in the Khan el Kalili Bazaar, Cairo.</p><br />
