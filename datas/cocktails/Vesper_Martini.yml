method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass.<br /><br

rate: 5.0
garnish: Lemon zest twist<br />
glass: Martini
comment: Many bartenders advocate that a Martini should be stirred and not shaken,
  some citing the ridiculous argument that shaking will "bruise the gin". If you like
  your Martinis shaken (as I do) then avoid the possible look of distaste from your
  server and order a Vesper. This Martini is always shaken, an action that aerates
  the drink, and makes it colder and more dilute than simply stirring. It also gives
  the drink a slightly clouded appearance and can leave small shards of ice on the
  surface of the drink. This is easily prevented by the use of a fine strainer when
  pouring.<br /><br />

variant: 
origin: 'This variation on the Dry Martini is said to have been created by Gilberto
  Preti at Duke''s Hotel, London, for the author Ian Fleming. He liked it so much
  that he included it in his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, published in 1951.<br
  />        <br />In chapter seven Bond explains to a Casino bartender exactly how
  to make and serve the drink: "In a deep champagne goblet. Three measures of Gordon''s,
  one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet [now called Lillet Blanc]. Shake it
  very well until it''s ice-cold, then add a large slice of lemon peel."<br />        <br
  />When made, 007 compliments the bartender, but tells him it would be better made
  with a grain-based vodka. He also explains his Martini to Felix Leiter, the CIA
  man, saying, &quot;This drink''s my own invention. I''m going to patent it when
  I can think of a good name.&quot;<br />        <br />In chapter eight, Bond meets
  the beautiful agent Vesper Lynd. She explains why her parents named her Vesper and
  Bond asks if she''d mind if he called his favourite Martini after her. Like so many
  of Bond''s love interests Vesper turns out to be a double agent and the book closes
  with his words, "The bitch is dead now."<br /><br />'
