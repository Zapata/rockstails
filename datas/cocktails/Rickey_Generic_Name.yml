origin: Believed to have been created at the Shoemaker's restaurant in Washington,
  circa 1900, and named after Colonel Joe Rickey for whom it was invented. Coincidentally
  or not, Rickey went on to become a major importer of limes into the US.<br />    <br
  />Many confuse the Rickey and the Collins. For the record a Rickey is made with
  lime juice and a Collins with lemon juice. A Rickey is also usually served in a
  shorter glass than a Collins but that difference is secondary.<br /><br />
