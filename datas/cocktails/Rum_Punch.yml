name: Rum Punch
method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into glass filled with crushed
  ice.
rate: 5.0
garnish: Orange slice &amp; cherry (sail)
glass: Collins
comment: The classic proportions of this drink (followed above) are 'one of sour,
  two of sweet, three of strong and four of weak' - referring to lime juice, sugar
  syrup, rum and water respectively. In Jamaica, the spiritual home of the Rum Punch,
  they like their rum overproof (more than 57% alc./vol) and serving over crushed
  dilutes and tames this very strong.
