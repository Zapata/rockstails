  Comment: The classic proportions of this drink (followed above) are 'one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong and four of weak' - referring to lime juice, sugar syrup, rum and water respectively. In Jamaica, the spiritual home of the Rum Punch, they like their rum overproof (more than 57% alc./vol) and serving over crushed dilutes and tames this very strong.
