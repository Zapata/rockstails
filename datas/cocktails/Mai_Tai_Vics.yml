origin: In 1934, Victor Jules Bergeron, or Trader Vic as he became known, opened his
  first restaurant in Oakland, San Francisco. He served Polynesian food with a mix
  of Chinese, French and American dishes cooked in wood-fired ovens. But he is best
  known for the rum based cocktails he created.<br />       <br />One evening in 1944
  he tested a new drink on two friends from Tahiti, Ham and Carrie Guild. After the
  first sip, Carrie exclaimed, &quot;Mai Tai-Roa A&quot;, which in Tahitian means
  'Out of this world - the best!'. So Bergeron named his drink the Mai Tai.<br />       <br
  />The original was based on 17 year old Jamaican J.Wray &amp; Nephew rum which Vic
  in his own guide describes as being "surprisingly golden in colour, medium bodied,
  but with the rich pungent flavour particular to the Jamaican blends". Vic states
  he used "rock candy" syrup, an old term for the type of strong sugar syrup I prescribe
  in this guide. The term referred to the fact that you could dangle a piece of string
  in it to encourage crystallisation and make rock candy.<br />       <br />When supplies
  of the Jamaican 17-year-old rum dwindled, Vic started using a combination of dark
  Jamaican rum and Martinique rum to achieve the desired flavour. Sheer demand in
  his chain of restaurants later necessitated the introduction of a Mai Tai pre-mix
  (still available from www.tradervics.com).<br />       <br />Others, particularly
  Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt, then owner of a Hollywood bar called Don the Beachcomber's,
  have also laid claim to the creation of this drink. But as Vic says in his own Bartender's
  Guide, "Anybody who says I didn't create this drink is a dirty stinker." This recipe
  is adapted from Victor Bergeron's 'Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide' (1972 revised
  edition).<br /><br />
