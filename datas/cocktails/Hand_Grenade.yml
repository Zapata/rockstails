origin: The above recipe bares little similarity to the notorious Hand Grenade served
  by the three Tropical Isle Bars and the Funky Pirate bar in New Orleans, USA. Marketed
  as "New Orleans' most powerful drink" and served in long plastic half-yard hand-grenade
  shaped vessels this green melon flavoured proprietary drink is available as a pre-mix
  by mail order from www.tropicalisle.com. In the USA the operators of Tropical Isle
  have trademarked Hand Grenade so preventing other establishments not licensed by
  Tropical Isle from selling cocktails of this name.<br /><br />
