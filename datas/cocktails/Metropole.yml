origin: Named after The Hotel Metropole, located just off Times Square at 147 West
  43rd Street. This was the first hotel in New York City to have running water in
  every room but had a less than salubrious reputation due to the clientele its all-night
  licensed street-level Caf Metropole attracted. As Albert Stevens Crockett says in
  his 1935, 'The Old Waldorf Bar Days', "Attributed to a once well known and somewhat
  lively hotel, whose bar was a long centre of life after dark in the Times Square
  district."<br />       <br />In the early morning hours of 16th July 1912 Herman
  Rosenthal, the owner of several New York gambling dens, was murdered as he left
  Caf Metropole (a crime recounted in the story of the Jack Rose). Just one week after
  the murder, The Hotel Metropole went bankrupt, later to become became the Hotel
  Rosoff.<br /><br />
