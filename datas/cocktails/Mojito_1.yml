origin: The exact origins of the Mojito and its name are lost in the mists of time.
  Some trace it back to 1586 and a medicinal drink named after Sir Francis Drake.
  He was one of a band of privateers sponsored by England's Queen Elizabeth I to plunder
  Spanish cities in the New World and seize their riches.<br />    <br />Cuba was
  under Spanish rule and King Philip II of Spain had warned his governor in Cuba that
  he believed Drake intended to raid Havana in order to seize the Aztec gold stored
  in the city's royal treasury. Thus Havana was well defended but there was still
  surprised relief in the city when, after several days of waiting, Drake sailed away
  from the richest port in the West Indies after firing only a few shots.<br />       <br
  />Drake left Havana and its gold intact, but his visit was a major event - something
  perhaps worthy of naming a drink after. Others say the drink was not originally
  Cuban and it was actually invented upon board Drake's ship which carried mint to
  mix with cane spirit, sugar and lime to make a drink to relieve fever and colds.<br
  />       <br />What is for certain is that the Draque, Drak or Drac was certainly
  drunk for its perceived medicinal value. During one of the worst cholera epidemics
  ever to hit Havana, the author Ramon de Paula wrote, "Every day at eleven o' clock
  I consume a little Drake made from aguardiente (local cane spirit) and I am doing
  very well."<br />    <br />At some time in the late 1890s the local cane spirit
  in the Draque was replaced with Bacardi Carta Blanca rum and over the decades the
  drink started to be made long. This is supported by Frederick Villoch in 1940 "...when
  aguardiente was replaced with rum, the Drake was to be called a Mojito." However,
  some still maintain the Mojito was invented after Americans visiting Cuba's thriving
  bar culture between the wars, and especially during Prohibition, introduced the
  locals to the Mint Julep.<br />    <br />The origins of the name 'Mojito' are equally
  misty. Some say it comes from 'mojar', a Spanish verb suggesting wetness. Others
  claim it comes from the African word 'mojo', meaning spell. <br />       <br />Bodeguita
  del Medio bar in Havana is by urban myth credited with the first Mojito and this
  is apparently where Ernest Hemingway went for his.  The great man wrote of Cuba's
  unofficial national drink, "it wasn't just a drink; it was a symbol of national
  pride." <br /><br />
