aka: Sandygaff
variant: 
origin: This drink and its name originated in England and dates back to at least the
  late 19th century. The name comes from the London slang for a pint of beer, 'shant
  of gatter' (shanty being a public house, gatter meaning water). The ginger ale serves
  as a flavoursome way to water down the strength of the beer, thus the literal translation,
  'pub water'.<br />    <br />In the first chapter of The History of Mr. Polly, H.
  G. Wells describes a shandygaff as being, "two pints of beer and two bottles of
  ginger beer foaming in a huge round-bellied jug."<br />    <br />In London the beer
  is now usually diluted with lemonade and this drink is now simply known as a shandy.
  When ordering in a pub you are expected to call for 'lager shandy' or 'bitter shandy',
  the latter specifying the drink should be based on traditional real ale.<br />    <br
  />Today the term 'Shandygaff' is forgotten in London but popular in the Caribbean
  where this drink is made with beer and ginger ale or ginger beer.<br /><br />
