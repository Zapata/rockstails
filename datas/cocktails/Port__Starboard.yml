  Comment: Easy to layer but hard to drink. Very sweet.
  Origin: Named after and inspired by the red and green running lights which respectively mark the 'Port' (left-hand) and 'Starboard' (right-hand) sides of a ship. The red light is called Port side because port wine is red. The original name for the opposite side was Larboard, but over the years was corrupted to Starboard.
