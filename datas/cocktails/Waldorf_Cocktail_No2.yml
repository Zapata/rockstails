name: Waldorf Cocktail No.2
method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass.<br /><br
  />
rate: 4.0
garnish: Lemon zest twist<br />
glass: Martini
comment: Lime works better than lemon but like the Astor, using a combination of lime
  and lemon makes for a better drink.<br /><br />
aka: 
variant: Astor
origin: This is the later of the two versions of this vintage cocktail from New York's
  Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It appears in the 1939 Caf Royale book and in the 1955 United
  Kingdom Bartender's Book. Both books offer a choice between using lemon or lime
  juice. The original recipe calls for two parts Swedish punch to one part gin but
  with the punches I've tried this makes for an overly sweet drink. <br /><br />
