rate: 4.5
garnish: Orange zest twist &amp; maraschino cherry

variant: 'Old Fashioned #1 (Classic Version)'
origin: 'In the US orange segments and sometimes even a maraschino cherry are regularly
  muddled in this drink: the practice probably originated during Prohibition as a
  means of disguising rough spirits. This practice is almost unknown in England and
  as Crosby Gaige wrote in 1944, "Serious-minded persons omit fruit salad from Old
  Fashioneds."<br /><br />'
