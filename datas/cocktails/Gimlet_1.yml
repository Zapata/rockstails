origin: 'In 1747, James Lind, a Scottish surgeon, discovered that consumption of citrus
  fruits helped prevent scurvy, one of the most common illnesses on board ship. (We
  now understand that scurvy is caused by a Vitamin C deficiency and that it is the
  vitamins in citrus fruit which help ward off the condition.) In 1867, the Merchant
  Shipping Act made it mandatory for all British ships to carry rations of lime juice
  for the crew.<br />        <br />Lauchlin Rose, the owner of a shipyard in Leith,
  Scotland, had been working to solve the problem of how to keep citrus juice fresh
  for months on board ship. In 1867 he patented a process for preserving fruit juice
  without alcohol. To give his product wider appeal he sweetened the mixture, packaged
  it in an attractive bottle and named it ''Rose''s Lime Cordial''.<br /><br />Once
  the benefits of drinking lime juice became more broadly known, British sailors consumed
  so much of the stuff, often mixed with their daily ration of rum and water (''grog''),
  that they became affectionately known as ''Limeys''. Naval officers mixed Rose''s
  lime cordial with gin to make Gimlets.<br />        <br />A ''gimlet'' was originally
  the name of a small tool used to tap the barrels of spirits which were carried on
  British Navy ships: this could be the origin of the drink''s name. Another story
  cites a naval doctor, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette (1857-1943), who
  is said to have mixed gin with lime ''to help the medicine go down''. Although this
  is a credible story it is not substantiated in his obituary in The Times, 6 October
  1943.<br /><br />'
