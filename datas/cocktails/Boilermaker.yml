method: POUR whiskey to brim of shot glass and then maoeuvre shot glass so it is held
  tight up against the inside base of an upturned Boston glass. Then quickly flip
  the Boston glass over so that the boubon is trapped in the now upside-down shot
  glass. Now pour beer into Boston glass over the whiskey filled shot glass.
rate: 5.0
garnish: 
glass: Shot
comment: When you get to the end of the beer the shot glass lifts and the whiskey
  is released as a chaser.
