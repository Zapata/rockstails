name: Mint Julep
method: Lightly MUDDLE (only bruise) mint in base of shaker. Add other ingredients,
  SHAKE with ice and strain into glass half filled with crushed ice. CHURN (stir)
  the drink with the crushed ice using a bar spoon. Top up the glass with more crushed
  ice and CHURN again. Repeat this process until the drink fills the glass and serve.
rate: 5.0
garnish: Mint sprig and slice of lemon
glass: Collins
comment: This superb drink is better if the shaker and its contents are placed in
  the refrigerator for several hours prior to mixing with ice. This allows the mint
  flavours to infuse in the bourbon.
