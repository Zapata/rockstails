origin: My adaptation of a Scottish classic. Legend has it that Atholl Brose was created
  by the Earl of Atholl in 1475 when he was trying to capture Iain MacDonald, Lord
  of the Isles and leader of a rebellion against the king. Hearing rumours that MacDonald
  was drawing his drinking water from a small well, the Earl ordered it to be filled
  with honey, whisky and oatmeal. MacDonald lingered at the well enjoying the concoction
  and was captured.
