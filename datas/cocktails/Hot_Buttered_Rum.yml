  STIR until honey and butter are dissolved.
rate: 4.0
garnish: Cinnamon stick and slice of lemon studded with cloves
glass: Toddy
comment: In 'The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', David Embury says, "The Hot Spiced Rum
  is bad enough, but the lump of butter is the final insult. It blends with the hot
  rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne!" It's
  rare for me to question Embury but I rather like this slightly oily, warming, spicy
  toddy.
