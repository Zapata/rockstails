origin: |-
  Long before the Martini, the V-shaped glass and the cocktail shaker,

  the drink of choice at society gatherings was punch and the punch bowl

  was the centre of activity at every party.<br />

  <br />

  Punch had existed in India for centuries before colonialists brought it

  back to Europe some time in the latter half of the 1600s. The name

  derives from the Hindi word for five, 'panch', and refers to the five

  key ingredients: alcohol, citrus, sugar, water and spices.<br />

  <br />In India, it was made with arrack (the Arabic word for liquor and a

  local spirit distilled from palm sap or sugar cane). Back in Britain it

  was common for punches to be spiced with nutmeg or tea.<br />

          <br />

  The classic proportions of a punch follow a mnemonic, 'one of sour, two

  of sweet, three of strong and four of weak.' It refers to lime juice,

  sugar, rum and water - the fifth element, spice was added to taste.<br />

          <br />

  The basic punch principle of balancing sweet and sour with spirit and

  dilution remains key to making a good cocktail to this day. Indeed, the

  essential punch ingredients - spirit, citrus, sugar and water - lie at

  the centre of most modern day cocktails including the Daiquiri, Sour,

  Margarita, Caipirinha and Sidecar. Today's bartenders are now also

  reintroducing the fifth punch ingredient by muddling or macerating

  herbs and spices in their cocktails.<br />
