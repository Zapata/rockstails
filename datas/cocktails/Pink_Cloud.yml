comment: To make this sweet after dinner drink I've used amaretto and pomegranate
  syrup in place of crème de noyaux. This almond flavoured liqueur made from apricot
  and peach stones is not currently available in the UK. US readers should use 2 shots
  of crème de noyaux in place of the first two ingredients.
