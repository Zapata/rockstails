  Comment: White chocolate come coconut ice-cream, only vaguely rescued from fluffiness by gin spirit.<br /><br />
  Origin: Created by Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert at the Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba. This recipe is adapted from a 1937 Bar Florida (later renamed Floridita) menu. The name refers to Pepin Rivero, who took over the Cuban El Diario de la Marina newspaper upon the death of his father Don Nicolas Rivero in 1944.<br /><br />
