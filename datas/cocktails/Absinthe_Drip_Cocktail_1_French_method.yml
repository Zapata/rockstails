name: 'Absinthe Drip Cocktail #1 (French method)'
method: POUR absinthe into glass. PLACE cube of sugar on a slotted absinthe spoon
  resting across the top of the glass. Using a bottle of chilled mineral water with
  a small hole in the cap, DRIP water over the sugar so it dissolves and drips into
  the glass. Traditionally the same amount of sugar is added as water but I find full
  strength absinthe requires more dilution. Add ice, stir and serve.
rate: 3.0
garnish: None<br />
glass: Absinthe glass or old-fashioned
comment: <p>Patience is a virtue. Slow dripping of the water is essential to dissolve
  the entire sugar cube and give the drink enough sweetness to balance the absinthe.</p>

variant: 
origin: <p>This is the traditional method of serving absinthe. It was common until
  shortly before the First World War, when the drink was banned in most countries.</p>
