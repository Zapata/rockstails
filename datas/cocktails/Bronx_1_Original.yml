    &lt;![endif]-->Created in 1906 by Johnny Solon, a bartender at <st1:state w:st="on">New York</st1:state>'s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Empire</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">State</st1:placetype>
     <st1:placetype w:st="on">Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> occupies the
    site today), and named after the newly opened Bronx Zoo. Reputedly the first
    cocktail to use fruit juice.<br />In his 1935, The Old Waldorf-Astoria
    book, A.S. Crockett published what his says is "Solon's own story of the
    Creation - of the <st1:place w:st="on">Bronx</st1:place>:"<br />&quot;We had a cocktail in those days
    called the Duplex, which had a pretty fair demand. One day, I was making one
    for a customer when in came Traverson, head waiter of the Empire Room - the main
    dining room in the original Waldorf. A Duplex was composed of equal parts of
    French [dry] and Italian [sweet] Vermouth, shaken up with squeezed orange peel,
    or two dashes of Orange Bitters. Traverson said, 'Why don't you get up a new
    cocktail? I have a customer who says you can't do it.'<br />" 'Can't I?' I replied.<br />"Well, I finished the Duplex I was
    making, and a thought came to me. I poured into a mixing glass the equivalent
    of two jiggers of Gordon Gin. Then I filled the jigger with orange juice, so
    that it made one-third of orange and two-thirds of gin. Then into the mixture I
    put a dash of each Italian and French Vermouth, shaking the thing up. I didn't
    taste it myself, but I poured it into a cocktail glass and handed it to
    Traverson and said: 'You are a pretty good judge. (He was.) See what you think
    of that.' Traverson tasted it. Then he swallowed it whole.<br />" 'By God!' he said, 'you've really
    got something new! That will make a big hit. Make me another and I will take it
    back to that customer in the dining room. Bet you'll sell a lot of them. Have
    you got plenty of oranges? If you haven't, you had better stock up, because I'm
    going to sell a lot of those cocktails during lunch.'<br />"The demand for <st1:place w:st="on">Bronx</st1:place>
    cocktails started that day. Pretty soon we were using a whole case of oranges a
    day. And then several cases.<br />"The name? No, it wasn't really named
    directly after the borough or the river so-called. I had been at the Bronx Zoo
    a day or so before, and saw, of course, a lot of beasts I had never known.
    Customers used to tell me of the strange animals they saw after a lot of mixed
    drinks. So when Traverson said to me, as he started to take the drink in to the
    customer, 'What'll I tell him is the name of this drink?' I thought of those
    animals, and said: 'Oh, you can tell him it is a "<st1:place w:st="on">Bronx</st1:place>."
