origin: Swizzles originated in the Caribbean. They are sour style drinks that, distinctively,
  must be churned with a swizzle stick.<br /><br />Originally a twig from a species
  of tree called Quararibea turbinata which grow in the southern islands of the Caribbean.
  These trees have forked branches, which make perfect swizzle sticks. Today swizzle
  sticks are usually made of metal or plastic and have several blades or fingers attached
  to the base at right angles to the shaft. To use one, simply immerse the blades
  in the drink, hold the shaft between the palms of both hands and rotate the stick
  rapidly by sliding your hands back and forth against it. If you do not have a bona
  fide swizzle stick, use a barspoon in the same manner.<br /><br />Swizzles can be
  served as short drinks or lengthened with mineral water.<br /><br />
