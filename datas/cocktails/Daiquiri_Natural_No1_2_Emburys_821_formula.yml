comment: Traditionally a Natural Daiquiri should always be based on light rum but
  if I should feel like breaking with tradition and using aged rum, I find Embury's
  8:2:1 formula works particularly well.<br /><br />

variant: 
origin: 'According to David A. Embury''s 1948 ''Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'' the classic
  proportions of a daiquiri are: 8 parts (2 shots) white label Cuban rum, 2 parts
  (1/2 shot) lime juice and 1 part (1/4 shot) sugar syrup. I have added the optional
  addition of water for increased dilution.<br /><br />'
