origin: Scotch &amp; Soda, Gin &amp; Tonic, Whiskey &amp; Ginger, Vodka &amp; Tonic
  and Rum &amp; Coke are all examples of Highball cocktails. Highballs are a type
  of simple cocktail with only two ingredients, normally a spirit and a carbonate,
  served in a tall ice-filled glass (often referred to as a highball glass). Unlike
  Rickeys, Collinses and Fizzes, Highballs do not contain citrus fruit juice.<br />        <br
  />In his 1934 'The Official Mixer's Guide', Patrick Gavin Duffy writes, &quot;It
  is one of my fondest hopes that the highball will again take its place as the leading
  American Drink. I admit to being prejudiced about this - it was I who first brought
  the highball to America, in 1895. Although the distinction is claimed by the Parker
  House in Boston, I was finally given due credit for this innovation in the New York
  Times of not many years ago.&quot;<br />        <br />That New York Times reference
  appears to be a letter written by Duffy on 22 October 1927 to the Editor in response
  to an editorial piece in the paper. He starts, "An editorial in The Times says that
  the Adams House, Boston, claims to have served the first Scotch highball in this
  country. This claim is unfounded." He goes on to tell of how in 1894 he opened a
  little cafe next the old Lyceum in New York City and that in the Spring of that
  year, an English actor and regular patron, E. J. Ratcliffe, one day asked for a
  Scotch and soda. At that time Duffy did not carry Scotch but this request and the
  growing number of English actors frequenting his bar led Duffy to order five cases
  of Usher's from Park &amp; Tilford. Duffy claims that when the shipment arrived
  he "sold little but Scotch highballs", consisting of "Scotch, a lump of ice and
  a bottle of club soda". His letter finishes, &quot;Shortly afterward every actor
  along Broadway, and consequently every New Yorker who frequented the popular bars,
  was drinking Scotch highballs. In a few years other Scotch distillers introduced
  their brands and many were enriched by the quantity consumed in this country. Actors
  on tour, and members of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery of Boston, who came
  here annually to attend the Old Guard Ball, brought the new drink to the Adams House."<br
  />    <br />Duffy's letter to The New York Times mentions Adam House in Boston while
  the reference in his subsequent book talks of "Parker House". Both are plausible
  Boston locations but does this confusion mean we should not take any of Duffy's
  claims for being the first to make Scotch Highballs in America seriously? The Times
  merely published Duffy's letter to the editor, the paper did not substantiate or
  even "give credit" to his claims.<br />    <br />In his 2003 'The Joy of Mixology',
  Gary Regan explains that "Highball is an old railroad term for the ball indicator
  connected to a float inside a steam train's water tank which told the conductor
  that there was enough water in the tank and so the train could proceed. Apparently
  when the train was set to depart, the conductor would give the highball - two short
  whistle blows and one long. Gary explains that this term was apt as the drinks consist
  of 2 shots of liquor and a long pour of mixer.<br /><br />
