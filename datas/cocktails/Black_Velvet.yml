variant: If porter is used instead of stout, this drink becomes simply a Velvet. If
  beer is used, it is known as the Halstead Street Velvet.
origin: Thought to have originated in 1861 at Brook's Club, London although some credit
  some credit the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin, Ireland. What is certain is that this
  drink was created at the time when Britain was morning the death of HRH Prince Albert,
  husband of Queen Victoria.<br />       <br />The Black Velvet is often served to
  commemorate Saint Patrick's Day but is more fittingly served on 14 December as this
  is the day Prince Albert died of typhoid fever in 1861. Devastated, the Queen wore
  black for the rest of her life so this drink's shrouding of champagne is most appropriate.<br
  />       <br />In his 1948 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks', David A. Embury writes of
  this drink, "I was first introduced to Black Velvet at the home of a very dear friend
  of mine in Montreal and I received one of the greatest of all the drinking surprises
  of my whole life. The combination of champagne and stout sounds terrifying - something
  like molasses and horseradish. Actually, its excellent. The champagne cuts the heavy,
  syrupy consistency of the stout, and the stout takes the sharp, tart edge off the
  champagne. Each is the perfect complement of the other. Be sure, however, that you
  use (a) a good bottle of stout, (b) an extra-dry champagne - preferably a brut or
  nature."<br /><br />
