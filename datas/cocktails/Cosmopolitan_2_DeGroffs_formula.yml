comment: Although it is generally agreed that the Cosmopolitan originated on America's
  West Coast sometime during the 1980s, this drink is most closely identified with
  New York City where bar legend, Dale DeGroff, and HBO's 'Sex and the City' perfected
  the drink and made it stylish.<br />    <br />This recipe is from Dale's 2002 'The
  Craft of the Cocktail' where he also explains that while he did not invent the Cosmopolitan,
  in his own words, "What I did do was popularize a definitive recipe that became
  widely accepted as the standard."<br /><br />Dale put the drink on his menu at New
  York's Rainbow Room in 1996 and shortly after it was reported that Madonna had enjoyed
  one. As a result Dale received calls from all over the world asking for the recipe,
  which he had perfected by adding a dash of Cointreau and a flamed orange peel twist.
  New York Magazine credited Dale with the drinks invention, other publications followed
  this and he was asked to present it on several television stations.<br />    <br
  />When the HBO television series, 'Sex and the City', debuted in 1998, its creators
  decided the cosmopolitan would be the perfect accompaniment to Carrie Bradshaw's
  fashionista Manhattan lifestyle. Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and sexpot Samantha
  where frequently shown sipping Cosmos and when the series hit the big screen in
  2008, the film closed with the girls questioning why they had ever stopped drinking
  them.<br /><br />
