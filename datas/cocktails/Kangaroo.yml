  AKA: Vodkatini
  Comment: Temperature is key to the enjoyment of this modern classic. Consume while icy cold.
  Origin: Bartending legend has it that 'Kangaroo' was the original name for a Vodkatini and the evidence usually put forward to collaborate this is the drinks listing in later editions of David A. Embury's 'Fine Art of Mixing Drinks'. However, the original 1948 edition omits this drink but does list a Vodka Martini served both 'dry' and 'perfect'.<br /><br />
