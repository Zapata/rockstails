  Comment: A White Lady with fresh mint and champagne
  Origin: Created during Prohibition, either at a New York City speakeasy called Jack &amp; Charlie's, or at Manhattan's Stork Club, or by Chicago's Southside gang to make their bootleg liquor more palatable.
  Variant: Topped with soda (from a siphon, please) in place of champagne this becomes a mere 'Southside'.
