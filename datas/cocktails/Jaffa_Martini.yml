origin: Created by Yours Truly (Simon Difford) in 2004. McVitie's Jaffa Cakes have
  a tangy orange jelly centre on a hardish sponge base, covered in dark chocolate.
  Back in 1991 these tasty little snacks beat off UK Customs &amp; Excise who sought
  to reclassify them as chocolate biscuits, which, unlike cakes, are categorised as
  luxuries and so subjected to Value Added Tax.
