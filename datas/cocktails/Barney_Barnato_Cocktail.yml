origin: " This cocktail is named after Barney Barnato, who was born Barnett Issacs
  in 1852 in the Whitechapel slum of London and traded on his Jewish-Cockney wit and
  humour. With only a box of cigars to his name, in 1873 Barney fled poverty to join
  his brother in the South African diamond rush and changed his name. He formed the
  Barnato Diamond Mining Company and within ten years he had become a millionaire.
  He and his brother were eventually forced to sell out to Cecil John Rhodes for lb5,338,650,
  then the single largest cheque that had been written. The fortune was little compensation
  for being beaten in the battle to control the Cape diamond mines - Rhodes went on
  to form the now mighty De Beers.<div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></div><div>After
  a brief spell in South African politics Barnato died in 1897 when he was lost overboard
  near the island of Madeira, whilst on a passage home to England. It is still questioned
  as to whether he jumped, fell or was pushed. His body was recovered but the mysterious
  circumstances of his death were never resolved. He is buried at Willesden Jewish
  Cemetery, London.</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span></div><div>His
  vast fortune was divided between his family, including his sister Sarah and her
  husband Abraham Rantzen, great-grandparents of TV presenter Esther Rantzen. Another
  beneficiary was his son, Woolf Barnato, who used part of this inheritance to become
  one of the so-called Bentley Boys racing drivers in the 1920s.</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"

  Craddock's 1930 'The Savoy Cocktail Book' which calls for a now defunct South African
  product called Caperitif. I have used Dubonnot Red in its place, but some consider
  white vermouth or aromatized wine a better substitute.</div><div><br /></div>"
