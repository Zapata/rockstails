rate: 4.0
garnish: Orange slice &amp; mint sprig
glass: Collins
comment: A tangy punch which harnesses the rich flavours of Myers's rum.
aka: 
variant: 
origin: Invented in the late 19th century by the founder of Myers's rum, Fred L. Myers.
  The recipe on the back of each bottles is known as the 'Old Plantation formula'  and
  uses classic rum punch proportions of 1 sour (lime), 2 sweet (sugar), 3 strong (rum)
  and 4 weak (water). Rather than this or the American formula ( 1 sour, 2 sweet,
  3 weak, and 4 strong), I've followed David A. Embury's recommendation of 1 sweet,
  2 sour, 3 strong and 4 weak.
