name: 'Mojito #2 (Difford''s method) '
method: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into ice-filled glass. CHURN
  (stir) with bar spoon. Fill glass with more crushed ice and CHURN some more. Keep
  adding ice and churning until drink fills glass. Serve with straws.<br /><br />
rate: 4.5
garnish: Mint sprig<br />
glass: Collins
comment: All the flavour of the Mojito but without unattractive mint leaves trapped
  in crushed ice. This only works when fresh, cold crushed ice is used. Otherwise
  the drink will be overly diluted.<br /><br />
