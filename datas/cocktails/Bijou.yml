comment: A shot loaded with bold flavours - fellow Chartreuse fans will approve.

variant: 
origin: 'This vintage layered, or ''pousse-caf'' style, drink is named after the French
  for ''jewel'', apparently a reference to its trio of ingredients having the colours
  of the three most precious jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and emerald
  (Green Chartreuse).<br />       <br />If all the ingredients, and so the colours,
  are shaken together the result is a rather better, aptly named drink called the
  Amber Dream. I wouldn''t ponce about making this layered drink. Grab a shaker and
  enjoy an Amber Dream.<br /><br />'
