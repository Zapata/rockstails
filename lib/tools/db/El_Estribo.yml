  Comment: Pink and creamy but with a tequila kick.
  Origin: "The signature drink at El Estribo, Mexico City, which sadly closed in 2005. The drink and this once legendary tequila bar's name 'estribo' is used to say &quot;one for the road&quot; in Mexico... before you get into the stirrups and ride away.<br /> "
