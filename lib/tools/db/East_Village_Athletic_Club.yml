  Comment: Essentially a Last Word with tequila instead of gin.
  Origin: The Last Word, a vintage cocktail classic, was first documented in Ted Saucier 's Bottoms Up in 1951 where its creation was attributed to the Detroit Athletic Club. In 2008 the folk at New York's PDT tinkered with the recipe to create this drink named after their own hood.<br /><br />
