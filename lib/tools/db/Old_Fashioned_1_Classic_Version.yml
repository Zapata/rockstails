  Origin: |-
    As <span ,="" ;="" georgia="" serif="" style="font-size: 10pt;">with the Martini, the glass this cocktail is served
    in has taken the name of the drink. The cocktails creation is credited to a
    bartender called Martin Cuneo at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky.
    USA. He is said to have made the drink for a Kentucky Colonel (and bourbon
    distiller) named James E. Pepper sometime between 1889 and 1895. In those days
    the clubhouse was situated at in the old Belknap family mansion located between
    Third and Fourth Streets on the south side of Walnut Street (now Muhammad Ali
    Blvd.) in Louisville. This was torn down and replaced by the current opulent
    Georgian clubhouse, located about a block to the east, at 218 West Walnut
    Street, which opened in late 1928.<br /><br />A number of sources collaborate the Old
    Fashioned originating the Pendennis Club, including the 1931 book, Old Waldorf
    Bar Days, in which it author, Albert Stevens Crocket, writes of this drink, &quot;This was brought to the Old Waldorf in the days of the 'sit-down' Bar, and was
    introduced by, or in the honor of, Col. James E. Pepper, of Kentucky, a
    proprietor of a celebrated whiskey of the period. It was said to have been the
    invention of a bartender at the famous Pendennis Club in Louisville, of which
    Col. Pepper was a member.&quot;</span><br /><br />
