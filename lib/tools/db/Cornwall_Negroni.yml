  Comment: A Negroni style cocktail served up. Heavy on the gin and relatively light on Campari and vermouth. It's a formula that works but like us, you may prefer yours served on the rocks. <br />
  Origin: Created in 2006 by Philip Ward, New York, USA after attending Gaz Regan's Cocktails in the Country workshop in Cornwall-on-Hudson. <br />
