  Comment: Sweet and far from sophisticated, but better than the fodder peddled at most clubs.
  Origin: Named after the Herbie Hancock track and popularised by a club night promoter called Cookie in Berlin during the mid-1990s. He started serving this cocktail at his club nights and now practically every bar in Berlin offers it. Try the original at his Cookie Club.
