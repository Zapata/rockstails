  Comment: I must confess to preferring my Manhattans served sweet, or perfect at a push. The Manhattan is complex, challenging and moreish. Best of all, it's available in a style to suit every palate.<br /><br />
  Origin: "Various origins for this drink abound. They include: in November 1874 at New York City's Manhattan Club for Lady Randolph Churchill. Sometime in the 1880s \"by a man named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway in the [eighteen] sixties\", and by a Col. Joe Walker on a yachting trip in New York.<br />    <br />That last story is the most recent I have come across and comes courtesy of Barry Popik's website barrypopik.com where Barry notes an entry in the Daily Journal, Racine, Wisconsin, 8 March 1899. The article purports that Col. Joe Walker ran the then-famous Crescent Hall Saloon in New Orleans, at the corner of Canal and St. Charles Streets and that some years before he went on a little yachting trip with a party of friends while in New York. \"By some oversight the liquid refreshments in the icebox were confined to Italian vermouth and plain whisky, and it occurred to the colonel that a palatable drink might be made by mixing the two. The results were so good that he experimented a little on his return to New Orleans, and soon perfected the Manhattan cocktail, as it is known today. It was christened in honor of his friends on Manhattan island, and the fame of the decoction soon spread all over the country. The true Manhattan cocktail is always made with Italian vermouth, but at half the places where they undertake to serve them, French [dry] vermouth is substituted, and the fine flavor is altogether destroyed. French vermouth is a sort of wine, while Italian vermouth is a cordial, pure and simple. They are as different as milk and molasses. A cocktail made from the French brand is no more a Manhattan cocktail than it is a Spanish omelette.\"<br /><br />"
  Variant: Manhattan Dry and Manhattan Perfect. Also served over ice in an old-fashioned glass.
