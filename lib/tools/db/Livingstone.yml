  Comment: The classic gin and vermouth Martini made more approachable with a dash of sugar.
  Origin: This 1930's classic was named after Doctor Livingstone, the famous African missionary.
  Variant: Use pomegranate syrup in place of sugar and you have a Red Livingstone, named after London's 'lefty' ex-mayor, Ken.
