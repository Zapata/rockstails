  Comment: The appropriately named brandy based drink benefits from dilution, hence my addition of a splash of water.
  Origin: Adapted from a recipe by Charles Schumann, Munich, Germany, and published in his 'American Bar'. Very similar to Jerry Thomas' Fancy Brandy Cocktail, published in his 1862 edition.
