  Comment: This might be a huge and classic drink in Mexico but it still seems like either a waste of good beer or little improvement to bad beer. Only in this guide due to being something of a classic in its own parts.<br /><br />
  Origin: Loosely translated as 'my cold beer', this drink, which is still popular in Mexico, is thought to have originated there sometime in the 1940s. There are many variations of this drink. It is sometimes served without ice and often with light Mexican lager. Even the spicy ingredients vary but the hot pepper sauce is a constant.<br /><br />
