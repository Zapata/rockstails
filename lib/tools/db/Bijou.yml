  Comment: A shot loaded with bold flavours - fellow Chartreuse fans will approve.
  Origin: "This vintage layered, or 'pousse-caf' style, drink is named after the French for 'jewel', apparently a reference to its trio of ingredients having the colours of the three most precious jewels: diamond (gin), ruby (sweet vermouth) and emerald (Green Chartreuse).<br />       <br />If all the ingredients, and so the colours, are shaken together the result is a rather better, aptly named drink called the Amber Dream. I wouldn't ponce about making this layered drink. Grab a shaker and enjoy an Amber Dream.<br /><br />"
