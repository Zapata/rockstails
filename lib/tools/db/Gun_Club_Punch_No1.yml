  Comment: This Trader Vic classic is balanced rather than sweet. Fruit juice and ice tone down rum's powerful blast.
  Origin: Victor Bergeron specified that this drink should be served in one of his bespoke green cartridge mugs (pictured here). This recipe comes<br />from 'Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide' (1972 revised edition).
