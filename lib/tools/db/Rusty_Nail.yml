  Comment: The liqueur smooths and wonderfully combines with the Scotch.
  Origin: Created in 1942 at a Hawaiian bar for the artist Theodore Anderson. The proportions of Scotch to Drambuie vary wildly and are a matter of taste. However, the 3:1 proportions used here appear most popular.<br /><br />
