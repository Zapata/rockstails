  Comment: A creamy frozen drink with real character.<br /><br /><span >Tip:</span> It pays to add the condensed milk and<br />Algarrobo (or malt extract) after starting the blender.<br />
  Origin: A traditional Peruvian drink I discovered at Tito's Restaurant, London, England. Algarrobo is extracted from the fruits of the tree of the same<br />name. It is a sticky honey-like liquid which I find tastes a little like malt extract.
