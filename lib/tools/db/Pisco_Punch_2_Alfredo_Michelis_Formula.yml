  Comment: This subtly flavoured drink is justifiably legendary.<br /><br /><span >Recipe for marinade:</span> Core and remove the rind<br />from one ripe pineapple. Cut the pineapple into<br />rings and then into wedges and place in a deep<br />container. Add 30 cloves and one litre of sugar<br />syrup and marinate for 24 hours.<br />
  Origin: Alfredo Micheli (who went by the nickname Mike) was employed at the Bank Exchange and spied on Duncan Nichol to learn how to make this legendary drink. After he believed he'd learnt the secret he left to start serving at a newly opened competitor to the Bank Exchange, Paoli's on Montgomery Street.
