  Comment: Strong, flavoursome Navy rum with a splash of scurvy-inhibiting lime. Too many and you'll be groggy in the morning.
  Origin: For over 300 years the British Navy issued a daily 'tot' of rum, sometimes with double issues before battle. In 1740, as an attempt to combat drunkenness, Admiral Vernon gave orders that the standard daily issue of half a pint of neat, high-proof rum be replaced with two servings of a quarter of a pint, diluted 4:1 with water. The Admiral was nicknamed 'Old Grogram' due to the waterproof grogram cloak he wore, so the mixture he introduced became known as 'grog'. Lime juice was often added to the grog in an attempt to prevent scurvy, lending British sailors their 'limey' nickname.<br />        <br />The 'tot' tradition, which started in Jamaica in 1665, was finally broken on 31st July 1970, a day now known as 'Black Tot Day' - although by then the 'tot' had been reduced to a meagre two ounces.<br />       <br />Sounds plausible to me but drinks historians now say that grog is earlier than Old Grogram.<br /><br />
