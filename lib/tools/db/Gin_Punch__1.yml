glass: Collins

  Comment: Light and refreshing - akin to alcoholic real lemonade.
  Origin: "This is a version of the drink for which Limmer's Hotel in London was most famed: a Captain Gronow recalled it in his 1860s memoirs as one of the top, if filthy and seedy, sporting hangouts of 1814, thanks in part to its 'famous gin-punch'. A bartender named John Collins worked there later in the 19th century, and was famous enough to inspire a limerick, so many believe he created the Collins, which is similar to gin punch, although the drink is not named in the rhyme which goes as follows:<br />My name is John Collins,<br />  head waiter at Limmer's,<br />Corner of Conduit Street,<br />  Hanover Square,<br />My chief occupation is filling<br />  brimmers<br />For all the young gentlemen<br />  frequenters there.<br /><br />"
