  Comment: The taste of this excellent drink (which is equally good served straight-up) is a little reminiscent of Earl Grey tea.
  Origin: This Polish drink takes its name from the film 'Dances With Wolves'. Tatanka is a Native American word for buffalo and refers to the Bison grass flavoured vodka the cocktail is based on.
